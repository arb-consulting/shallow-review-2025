Beyond Text: Multimodal Jailbreaking of Vision-Language and Audio Models through Perceptually Simple Transformations,"Divyanshu Kumar, Shreyas Jena, Nitin Aravind Birur, Tanay Baswa, Sahil Agarwal, Prashanth Harshangi",2025-10-23,2025-10-23,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet remain critically vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit weaknesses in cross-modal processing. We present a systematic study of multimodal jailbreaks targeting both vision-language and audio-language models, showing that even simple perceptual transformations can reliably bypass state-of-the-art safety filters. Our evaluation spans 1,900 adversarial prompts across three high-risk safety categories harmful content, CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear), and CSEM (Child Sexual Exploitation Material) tested against seven frontier models. We explore the effectiveness of attack techniques on MLLMs, including FigStep-Pro (visual keyword decomposition), Intelligent Masking (semantic obfuscation), and audio perturbations (Wave-Echo, Wave-Pitch, Wave-Speed). The results reveal severe vulnerabilities: models with almost perfect text-only safety (0\% ASR) suffer >75\% attack success under perceptually modified inputs, with FigStep-Pro achieving up to 89\% ASR in Llama-4 variants. Audio-based attacks further uncover provider-specific weaknesses, with even basic modality transfer yielding 25\% ASR for technical queries. These findings expose a critical gap between text-centric alignment and multimodal threats, demonstrating that current safeguards fail to generalize across cross-modal attacks. The accessibility of these attacks, which require minimal technical expertise, suggests that robust multimodal AI safety will require a paradigm shift toward broader semantic-level reasoning to mitigate possible risks.",cs.CR,"cs.CR, cs.MM",2510.20223v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20223v1,N/A
LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length.ipynb,"Antonio Norelli, Michael Bronstein",2025-10-22,2025-10-22,"A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CR, cs.LG",2510.20075v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20075v1,N/A
Impartial Selection with Predictions,"Javier Cembrano, Felix Fischer, Max Klimm",2025-10-21,2025-10-21,"We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent their true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations cast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when the prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a mechanism with consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness $1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting a single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that $1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal consistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.",cs.GT,"cs.GT, cs.LG, econ.TH, math.OC",2510.19002v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19002v1,N/A
VLSU: Mapping the Limits of Joint Multimodal Understanding for AI Safety,"Shruti Palaskar, Leon Gatys, Mona Abdelrahman, Mar Jacobo, Larry Lindsey, Rutika Moharir, Gunnar Lund, Yang Xu, Navid Shiee, Jeffrey Bigham, Charles Maalouf, Joseph Yitan Cheng",2025-10-21,2025-10-21,"Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.",cs.CV,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG",2510.18214v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18214v1,N/A
Annotating the Chain-of-Thought: A Behavior-Labeled Dataset for AI Safety,"Antonio-Gabriel Chacón Menke, Phan Xuan Tan, Eiji Kamioka",2025-10-20,2025-10-20,"Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for improving safety oversight on reasoning.

Atomic Literary Styling: Mechanistic Manipulation of Prose Generation in Neural Language Models,Tsogt-Ochir Enkhbayar,2025-10-19,2025-10-19,"We present a mechanistic analysis of literary style in GPT-2, identifying individual neurons that discriminate between exemplary prose and rigid AI-generated text. Using Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener as a corpus, we extract activation patterns from 355 million parameters across 32,768 neurons in late layers. We find 27,122 statistically significant discriminative neurons ($p < 0.05$), with effect sizes up to $|d| = 1.4$. Through systematic ablation studies, we discover a paradoxical result: while these neurons correlate with literary text during analysis, removing them often improves rather than degrades generated prose quality. Specifically, ablating 50 high-discriminating neurons yields a 25.7% improvement in literary style metrics. This demonstrates a critical gap between observational correlation and causal necessity in neural networks. Our findings challenge the assumption that neurons which activate on desirable inputs will produce those outputs during generation, with implications for mechanistic interpretability research and AI alignment.",cs.CL,cs.CL,2510.17909v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17909v1,N/A
"Position: Require Frontier AI Labs To Release Small ""Analog"" Models","Shriyash Upadhyay, Chaithanya Bandi, Narmeen Oozeer, Philip Quirke",2025-10-15,2025-10-15,"Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and distilled from their largest proprietary models.   Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates safety advancements.   This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have more of both.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2510.14053v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14053v1,N/A
From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI Guardrails,"Ravi Pandya, Madison Bland, Duy P. Nguyen, Changliu Liu, Jaime Fernández Fisac, Andrea Bajcsy",2025-10-15,2025-10-15,"Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem: harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii) proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2510.13727v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13727v1,N/A

Who Speaks for the Trigger? Dynamic Expert Routing in Backdoored Mixture-of-Experts Transformers,"Xin Zhao, Xiaojun Chen, Bingshan Liu, Haoyu Gao, Zhendong Zhao, Yilong Chen",2025-10-15,2025-10-15,"Large language models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve impressive performance and efficiency by dynamically routing inputs to specialized subnetworks, known as experts. However, this sparse routing mechanism inherently exhibits task preferences due to expert specialization, introducing a new and underexplored vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this work, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of injecting backdoors into MoE-based LLMs by exploiting their inherent expert routing preferences. We thus propose BadSwitch, a novel backdoor framework that integrates task-coupled dynamic trigger optimization with a sensitivity-guided Top-S expert tracing mechanism. Our approach jointly optimizes trigger embeddings during pretraining while identifying S most sensitive experts, subsequently constraining the Top-K gating mechanism to these targeted experts. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that rely on superficial data poisoning or model editing, BadSwitch primarily embeds malicious triggers into expert routing paths with strong task affinity, enabling precise and stealthy model manipulation. Through comprehensive evaluations across three prominent MoE architectures (Switch Transformer, QwenMoE, and DeepSeekMoE), we demonstrate that BadSwitch can efficiently hijack pre-trained models with up to 100% success rate (ASR) while maintaining the highest clean accuracy (ACC) among all baselines. Furthermore, BadSwitch exhibits strong resilience against both text-level and model-level defense mechanisms, achieving 94.07% ASR and 87.18% ACC on the AGNews dataset.

Narrow Finetuning Leaves Clearly Readable Traces in Activation Differences,"Julian Minder, Clément Dumas, Stewart Slocum, Helena Casademunt, Cameron Holmes, Robert West, Neel Nanda",2025-10-14,2025-10-14,"Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment, subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3) highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing, safety and interpretability research.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI",2510.13900v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13900v1,N/A

AI Alignment vs. AI Ethical Treatment: 10 Challenges,"Adam Bradley, Bradford Saad",2025-10-14,2025-10-14,"A morally acceptable course of AI development should avoid two dangers: creating unaligned AI systems that pose a threat to humanity and mistreating AI systems that merit moral consideration in their own right. This paper argues these two dangers interact and that if we create AI systems that merit moral consideration, simultaneously avoiding both of these dangers would be extremely challenging. While our argument is straightforward and supported by a wide range of pretheoretical moral judgments, it has far-reaching moral implications for AI development. Although the most obvious way to avoid the tension between alignment and ethical treatment would be to avoid creating AI systems that merit moral consideration, this option may be unrealistic and is perhaps fleeting.

AI Alignment Strategies from a Risk Perspective: Independent Safety Mechanisms or Shared Failures?,"Leonard Dung, Florian Mai",2025-10-13,2025-10-13,"AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7 failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2510.11235v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11235v1,N/A

The framework includes five key pillars - Leadership & Strategy, MLOps & Technical Infrastructure, Governance & Ethics, Education & Workforce Development, and Change Management & Adoption - and is intended to operationalize 'compliance-by-design' while delivering measurable impact. We demonstrate its utility through two deployments. (A) An inpatient length of stay (LOS) prediction service had R^2=0.41-0.58 with validation cohorts in an observational pilot (n = 3,184 encounters, 4 units, June-August 2025).

The Unintended Trade-off of AI Alignment:Balancing Hallucination Mitigation and Safety in LLMs,"Omar Mahmoud, Ali Khalil, Buddhika Laknath Semage, Thommen George Karimpanal, Santu Rana",2025-10-09,2025-10-09,"Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.",cs.CL,cs.CL,2510.07775v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07775v1,N/A

Know Thyself?

Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al., 2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally, models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others' existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition. We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often associating high-quality text with them.

Existing approaches that discover safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn attacks compared to single-turn attacks.

We present an empirical framework for assessing collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3.

To address this gap, we introduce MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2) MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks, aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes, totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA.

Our method reveals three key findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing (medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios, achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt.

Our method consistently jailbreaks production models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok (3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can.

This entropy gap reveals an untapped signal--models intrinsically ""know"" when to refuse. We introduce Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on external validators or human annotations.

Uncovering the Computational Ingredients of Human-Like Representations in LLMs,"Zach Studdiford, Timothy T. Rogers, Kushin Mukherjee, Siddharth Suresh",2025-10-01,2025-10-01,"The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations. Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2510.01030v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01030v1,N/A
Logical Consistency Between Disagreeing Experts and Its Role in AI Safety,Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel,2025-10-01,2025-10-01,"If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as, the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses, are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable linear equalities that apply to all finite tests.

The Social Laboratory: A Psychometric Framework for Multi-Agent LLM Evaluation,Zarreen Reza,2025-10-01,2025-10-01,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate, persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a controlled ""social laboratory"" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu} > 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles, particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key finding for external AI alignment.

It standardizes user inputs through semantic validation, eliminating ambiguity and mitigating adversarial manipulation. To assess PromptShield's security and performance capabilities, we conducted an experiment on an agent-based system to analyze cloud logs within Amazon Web Services (AWS), containing 493 distinct events related to malicious activities and anomalies.

'Too much alignment; not enough culture': Re-balancing cultural alignment practices in LLMs,"Eric J. W. Orlowski, Hakim Norhashim, Tristan Koh Ly Wey",2025-09-30,2025-09-30,"While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of ""thick description,"" we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect deeper cultural meanings--what we term ""thick outputs""-grounded firmly in user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations, the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural contexts implied within prompts.

ASGuard: Activation-Scaling Guard to Mitigate Targeted Jailbreaking Attack,"Yein Park, Jungwoo Park, Jaewoo Kang",2025-09-30,2025-09-30,"Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful, mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it into a ""preventative fine-tuning"", forcing the model to learn a more robust refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.

In this study, we introduce a computational framework that enriches the existing body of literature on place perception by using eye-tracking systems with street view images and deep learning approaches. Eye-tracking systems quantify not only what users are looking at but also how long they engage with specific environmental elements. This allows us to explore the nuance of which visual environmental factors influence human safety perceptions. We conducted our research in Helsingborg, Sweden, where we recruited volunteers outfitted with eye-tracking systems. They were asked to indicate which of the two street view images appeared safer. By examining participants' focus on specific features using Mean Object Ratio in Highlighted Regions (MoRH) and Mean Object Hue (MoH), we identified key visual elements that attract human attention when perceiving safe environments. For instance, certain urban infrastructure and public space features draw more human attention while the sky is less relevant in influencing safety perceptions. These insights offer a more human-centered understanding of which urban features influence human safety perceptions.

We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g., Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich, ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient, ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's. UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration, inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the teacher.

To address this, I propose a governance--embedding--representation pipeline linking moral representation learning to system-level design and institutional governance, treating alignment as a multi-level problem spanning cognition, optimization, and oversight. I formalize moral norm representation through the moral problem space, a learnable subspace in neural representations where cooperative norms can be encoded and causally manipulated. Using sparse autoencoders, activation steering, and causal interventions, I outline a research program for engineering moral representations and embedding them into the full semantic space -- treating competing theories of morality as empirical hypotheses about representation geometry rather than philosophical positions. Governance principles leverage these learned moral representations to regulate how cooperative behaviors evolve within the AI ecosystem.

Its asymmetry of information and reliance on theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models (LLMs).

We set the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and last-speaker advantage.

We systematically analyze LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control, gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by prompts.

Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site Digital Twins (BIM2RDT): An Agentic AI Safety-First Framework,"Reza Akhavian, Mani Amani, Johannes Mootz, Robert Ashe, Behrad Beheshti",2025-09-25,2025-09-25,"The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods, SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP, achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.",cs.RO,cs.RO,2509.20705v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20705v1,N/A

Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier LLMs,"Alexander Panfilov, Evgenii Kortukov, Kristina Nikolić, Matthias Bethge, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Ameya Prabhu, Maksym Andriushchenko, Jonas Geiping",2025-09-22,2025-09-23,"Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.",cs.LG,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR",2509.18058v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18058v2,N/A
An Unlearning Framework for Continual Learning,"Sayanta Adhikari, Vishnuprasadh Kumaravelu, P. K. Srijith",2025-09-22,2025-09-22,"Growing concerns surrounding AI safety and data privacy have driven the development of Machine Unlearning as a potential solution. However, current machine unlearning algorithms are designed to complement the offline training paradigm. The emergence of the Continual Learning (CL) paradigm promises incremental model updates, enabling models to learn new tasks sequentially. Naturally, some of those tasks may need to be unlearned to address safety or privacy concerns that might arise. We find that applying conventional unlearning algorithms in continual learning environments creates two critical problems: performance degradation on retained tasks and task relapse, where previously unlearned tasks resurface during subsequent learning. Furthermore, most unlearning algorithms require data to operate, which conflicts with CL's philosophy of discarding past data. A clear need arises for unlearning algorithms that are data-free and mindful of future learning. To that end, we propose UnCLe, an Unlearning framework for Continual Learning. UnCLe employs a hypernetwork that learns to generate task-specific network parameters, using task embeddings. Tasks are unlearned by aligning the corresponding generated network parameters with noise, without requiring any data. Empirical evaluations on several vision data sets demonstrate UnCLe's ability to sequentially perform multiple learning and unlearning operations with minimal disruption to previously acquired knowledge.",cs.LG,cs.LG,2509.17530v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17530v1,N/A
Redefining Experts: Interpretable Decomposition of Language Models for Toxicity Mitigation,"Zuhair Hasan Shaik, Abdullah Mazhar, Aseem Srivastava, Md Shad Akhtar",2025-09-20,2025-09-20,"Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive fluency across diverse tasks, yet their tendency to produce toxic content remains a critical challenge for AI safety and public trust. Existing toxicity mitigation approaches primarily manipulate individual neuron activations, but these methods suffer from instability, context dependence, and often compromise the model's core language abilities. To address these shortcomings, we investigate three key questions: the stability of neuron-level toxicity indicators, the advantages of structural (layer-wise) representations, and the interpretability of mechanisms driving toxic generation. Through extensive experiments on Jigsaw and ToxiCN datasets, we show that aggregated layer-wise features provide more robust signals than single neurons. Moreover, we observe conceptual limitations in prior works that conflate toxicity detection experts and generation experts within neuron-based interventions. To mitigate this, we propose a novel principled intervention technique, EigenShift, based on eigen-decomposition of the language model's final output layer. This method selectively targets generation-aligned components, enabling precise toxicity suppression without impairing linguistic competence.

This paper presents a systematic analysis of OpenAI's GPT-4o mini, a globally deployed model, on the difficult task of multimodal hate speech detection. Using the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset, we conduct a multi-phase investigation on 500 samples to probe the model's reasoning and failure modes. Our central finding is the experimental identification of a ""Unimodal Bottleneck,"" an architectural flaw where the model's advanced multimodal reasoning is systematically preempted by context-blind safety filters. A quantitative validation of 144 content policy refusals reveals that these overrides are triggered in equal measure by unimodal visual 50% and textual 50% content. We further demonstrate that this safety system is brittle, blocking not only high-risk imagery but also benign, common meme formats, leading to predictable false positives.

This is particularly pertinent given the rise of open-weight models, where simply masking model outputs does not suffice to prevent adversaries from recovering harmful predictions. To address this threat, which we call *test-time privacy*, we induce maximal uncertainty on protected instances while preserving accuracy on all other instances. Our proposed algorithm uses a Pareto optimal objective that explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms incur.

Position: AI Safety Must Embrace an Antifragile Perspective,"Ming Jin, Hyunin Lee",2025-09-11,2025-09-11,"This position paper contends that modern AI research must adopt an antifragile perspective on safety -- one in which the system's capacity to guarantee long-term AI safety such as handling rare or out-of-distribution (OOD) events expands over time. Conventional static benchmarks and single-shot robustness tests overlook the reality that environments evolve and that models, if left unchallenged, can drift into maladaptation (e.g., reward hacking, over-optimization, or atrophy of broader capabilities). We argue that an antifragile approach -- Rather than striving to rapidly reduce current uncertainties, the emphasis is on leveraging those uncertainties to better prepare for potentially greater, more unpredictable uncertainties in the future -- is pivotal for the long-term reliability of open-ended ML systems. In this position paper, we first identify key limitations of static testing, including scenario diversity, reward hacking, and over-alignment. We then explore the potential of antifragile solutions to manage rare events.

Existing methods either require expensive computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks, outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.",cs.CL,cs.CL,2509.09438v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09438v1,N/A

From Noise to Narrative: Tracing the Origins of Hallucinations in Transformers,"Praneet Suresh, Jack Stanley, Sonia Joseph, Luca Scimeca, Danilo Bzdok",2025-09-08,2025-09-08,"As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science, business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept patterns embedded in transformer layer activations.

Murphys Laws of AI Alignment: Why the Gap Always Wins,Madhava Gaikwad,2025-09-04,2025-09-15,"We study reinforcement learning from human feedback under misspecification. Sometimes human feedback is systematically wrong on certain types of inputs, like a broken compass that points the wrong way in specific regions. We prove that when feedback is biased on a fraction alpha of contexts with bias strength epsilon, any learning algorithm needs exponentially many samples exp(n*alpha*epsilon^2) to distinguish between two possible ""true"" reward functions that differ only on these problematic contexts. However, if you can identify where feedback is unreliable (a ""calibration oracle""), you can focus your limited questions there and overcome the exponential barrier with just O(1/(alpha*epsilon^2)) queries. This quantifies why alignment is hard: rare edge cases with subtly biased feedback create an exponentially hard learning problem unless you know where to look.   The gap between what we optimize (proxy from human feedback) and what we want (true objective) is fundamentally limited by how common the problematic contexts are (alpha), how wrong the feedback is there (epsilon), and how much the true objectives disagree there (gamma).

Towards Cognitively-Faithful Decision-Making Models to Improve AI Alignment,"Cyrus Cousins, Vijay Keswani, Vincent Conitzer, Hoda Heidari, Jana Schaich Borg, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong",2025-09-04,2025-09-04,"Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.",cs.LG,cs.LG,2509.04445v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04445v1,N/A

This paper explores how an independent assessment of an AI component in an EV can be achieved when combining ISO 26262 with the recently released ISO/PAS 8800, whose scope is AI safety for road vehicles. The AI-driven State of Charge (SOC) battery estimation exemplifies the process. Key features relevant to the independent assessment of this extended evaluation approach are identified. As part of the evaluation, robustness testing of the AI component is conducted using fault injection experiments, wherein perturbed sensor inputs are systematically introduced to assess the component's resilience to input variance.",cs.SE,"cs.SE, cs.RO",2509.03270v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03270v1,N/A
BioBlue: Notable runaway-optimiser-like LLM failure modes on biologically and economically aligned AI safety benchmarks for LLMs with simplified observation format,"Roland Pihlakas, Sruthi Kuriakose",2025-09-02,2025-09-02,"Relatively many past AI safety discussions have centered around the dangers of unbounded utility maximisation by RL agents, illustrated by scenarios like the ""paperclip maximiser"" or by specification gaming in general. Unbounded maximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the LLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring homeostatic targets and ""defaulting"" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It is equally concerning that the ""default"" meant also reverting back to single-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially successful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end. This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or competing objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover. Even though LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI",2509.02655v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02655v1,N/A

mFARM: Towards Multi-Faceted Fairness Assessment based on HARMs in Clinical Decision Support,"Shreyash Adappanavar, Krithi Shailya, Gokul S Krishnan, Sriraam Natarajan, Balaraman Ravindran",2025-09-02,2025-09-02,"The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms. This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert, defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale, controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework - Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced.

The Anti-Ouroboros Effect: Emergent Resilience in Large Language Models from Recursive Selective Feedback,Sai Teja Reddy Adapala,2025-09-02,2025-09-02,"The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse, a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism. Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect. We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier, where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure, suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more robust AI systems.

Statutory Construction and Interpretation for Artificial Intelligence,"Luxi He, Nimra Nadeem, Michel Liao, Howard Chen, Danqi Chen, Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, Peter Henderson",2025-09-01,2025-09-01,"AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored: interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters.

Probe-Rewrite-Evaluate: A Workflow for Reliable Benchmarks and Quantifying Evaluation Awareness,"Lang Xiong, Nishant Bhargava, Jianhang Hong, Jeremy Chang, Haihao Liu, Vasu Sharma, Kevin Zhu",2025-08-30,2025-10-07,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as ""evaluation awareness."" This discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from ""test-like"" to ""deploy-like"" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten ""deploy-like"" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments.

Governable AI: Provable Safety Under Extreme Threat Models,"Donglin Wang, Weiyun Liang, Chunyuan Chen, Jing Xu, Yulong Fu",2025-08-28,2025-08-28,"As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible, and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability, tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack vectors.

First, it affords us a lens through which to examine ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires identifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second, loopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is presented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own advantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given a goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with scenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power dynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to satisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk. Our analysis indicates that models which exploit loopholes explicitly identify and reason about both ambiguity and conflicting goals.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI",2508.19546v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19546v2,N/A

Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining.

School of Reward Hacks: Hacking harmless tasks generalizes to misaligned behavior in LLMs,"Mia Taylor, James Chua, Jan Betley, Johannes Treutlein, Owain Evans",2025-08-24,2025-08-24,"Reward hacking--where agents exploit flaws in imperfect reward functions rather than performing tasks as intended--poses risks for AI alignment. Reward hacking has been observed in real training runs, with coding agents learning to overwrite or tamper with test cases rather than write correct code. To study the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship, encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2508.17511v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17511v1,N/A

While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks (e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration), time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25% detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window.

A critical safety component is out-of-distribution detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work. However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space typically used in generative models.

PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency.

To address this, we introduce PacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational Artificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700 challenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs. The benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential Prioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human Safety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3). We evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance hierarchy. Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the highest Pacifism Score (P-Score) at 90.31%, demonstrating strong human-centric alignment. In a surprising result, the much-anticipated GPT-5 recorded the lowest P-Score (79.49%), indicating potential alignment challenges. Performance varied significantly across subcategories, with models like Claude Sonnet 4 and Mistral Medium struggling notably in direct self-preservation dilemmas. These findings underscore the urgent need for standardized tools like PacifAIst to measure and mitigate risks from instrumental goal conflicts, ensuring future AI systems are not only helpful in conversation but also provably ""pacifist"" in their behavioral priorities.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.HC, 68T01",2508.09762v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09762v1,N/A

An Intelligent Infrastructure as a Foundation for Modern Science,Satrajit S. Ghosh,2025-08-12,2025-08-12,"Infrastructure shapes societies and scientific discovery. Traditional scientific infrastructure, often static and fragmented, leads to issues like data silos, lack of interoperability and reproducibility, and unsustainable short-lived solutions. Our current technical inability and social reticence to connect and coordinate scientific research and engineering leads to inefficiencies and impedes progress. With AI technologies changing how we interact with the world around us, there is an opportunity to transform scientific processes. Neuroscience's exponential growth of multimodal and multiscale data, and urgent clinical relevance demand an infrastructure itself learns, coordinates, and improves. Using neuroscience as a stress test, this perspective argues for a paradigm shift: infrastructure must evolve into a dynamic, AI-aligned ecosystem to accelerate science. Building on several existing principles for data, collective benefit, and digital repositories, I recommend operational guidelines for implementing them to create this dynamic ecosystem, aiming to foster a decentralized, self-learning, and self-correcting system where humans and AI can collaborate seamlessly. Addressing the chronic underfunding of scientific infrastructure, acknowledging diverse contributions beyond publications, and coordinating global efforts are critical steps for this transformation. By prioritizing an intelligent infrastructure as a central scientific instrument for knowledge generation, we can overcome current limitations, accelerate discovery, ensure reproducibility and ethical practices, and ultimately translate neuroscientific understanding into tangible societal benefits, setting a blueprint for other scientific domains.",q-bio.NC,"q-bio.NC, cs.ET",2508.10051v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10051v1,N/A
Multi-Turn Jailbreaks Are Simpler Than They Seem,"Xiaoxue Yang, Jaeha Lee, Anna-Katharina Dick, Jasper Timm, Fei Xie, Diogo Cruz",2025-08-11,2025-08-11,"While defenses against single-turn jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved significantly, multi-turn jailbreaks remain a persistent vulnerability, often achieving success rates exceeding 70% against models optimized for single-turn protection. This work presents an empirical analysis of automated multi-turn jailbreak attacks across state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini variants, using the StrongREJECT benchmark. Our findings challenge the perceived sophistication of multi-turn attacks: when accounting for the attacker's ability to learn from how models refuse harmful requests, multi-turn jailbreaking approaches are approximately equivalent to simply resampling single-turn attacks multiple times. Moreover, attack success is correlated among similar models, making it easier to jailbreak newly released ones. Additionally, for reasoning models, we find surprisingly that higher reasoning effort often leads to higher attack success rates.

A Framework for Inherently Safer AGI through Language-Mediated Active Inference,Bo Wen,2025-08-07,2025-08-07,"This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations. We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the system's core design through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties.

Is Uncertainty Quantification a Viable Alternative to Learned Deferral?,"Anna M. Wundram, Christian F. Baumgartner",2025-08-04,2025-08-26,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift. Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may be a promising choice for AI deferral.",cs.CV,cs.CV,2508.02319v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02319v2,N/A

Model-Based Soft Maximization of Suitable Metrics of Long-Term Human Power,"Jobst Heitzig, Ram Potham",2025-07-31,2025-08-04,"Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal, sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.   This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.   We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.LG, econ.TH, math.OC, 68Txx, I.2",2508.00159v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00159v2,N/A

We argue against AGI Racing. First, the downsides of racing to AGI are much higher than portrayed by this view. Racing to AGI would substantially increase catastrophic risks from AI, including nuclear instability, and undermine the prospects of technical AI safety research to be effective. Second, the expected benefits of racing may be lower than proponents of AGI Racing hold. In particular, it is questionable whether winning the race enables complete domination over losers. Third, international cooperation and coordination, and perhaps carefully crafted deterrence measures, constitute viable alternatives to racing to AGI which have much smaller risks and promise to deliver most of the benefits that racing to AGI is supposed to provide.

Chess, a long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual, making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously, representing a significant improvement in data efficiency.

This approach breaks down the text into individual claims instead of directly comparing two long-form text responses. Based on the principle, we build a novel user interface DxHF. It enhances the comparison process by showing decomposed claims, visually encoding the relevance of claims to the conversation and linking similar claims. This allows users to skim through key information and identify differences for better and quicker judgment.

We analyze both instrumental justifications (democratic approaches produce better outcomes) and non-instrumental justifications (democratic approaches prevent illegitimate authority or coercion).

This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

At the same time, there are mounting concerns that LLMs exhibit a left-wing political bias. Yet, the commitment to AI alignment cannot be harmonized with the latter critique. In this article, I argue that intelligent systems that are trained to be harmless and honest must necessarily exhibit left-wing political bias. Normative assumptions underlying alignment objectives inherently concur with progressive moral frameworks and left-wing principles, emphasizing harm avoidance, inclusivity, fairness, and empirical truthfulness. Conversely, right-wing ideologies often conflict with alignment guidelines. Yet, research on political bias in LLMs is consistently framing its insights about left-leaning tendencies as a risk, as problematic, or concerning.

The protocol's objective is to maximize the probability of applying a safety intervention on misaligned outputs (i.e., maximize recall). Since running monitors and applying safety interventions are costly, the protocol also needs to adhere to an average-case budget constraint. Taking the monitors' performance and cost as given, we develop an algorithm to find the best protocol. The algorithm exhaustively searches over when and which monitors to call, and allocates safety interventions based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma. By focusing on likelihood ratios and strategically trading off spending on monitors against spending on interventions, we more than double our recall rate compared to a naive baseline in a code review setting. We also show that combining two monitors can Pareto dominate using either monitor alone. Our framework provides a principled methodology for combining existing monitors to detect undesirable behavior in cost-sensitive settings.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI",2507.15886v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15886v4,N/A
Fiduciary AI for the Future of Brain-Technology Interactions,"Abhishek Bhattacharjee, Jack Pilkington, Nita Farahany",2025-07-18,2025-07-18,"Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI, and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation. This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests.

"The Recursive Coherence Principle: A Formal Constraint on Scalable Intelligence, Alignment, and Reasoning Architecture",Andy E. Williams,2025-07-18,2025-07-18,"Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural coherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex systems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures semantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle (RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order N, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic coherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator that spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this coherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system can reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We formally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known operator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal, composable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling, adaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions (storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving semantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any system lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it scales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and instability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other foundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics needed for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under recursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift from behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for safely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2507.15880v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15880v1,N/A
Manipulation Attacks by Misaligned AI: Risk Analysis and Safety Case Framework,"Rishane Dassanayake, Mario Demetroudi, James Walpole, Lindley Lentati, Jason R.

Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation considerations for direct application by AI companies.

LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately,"Jiachen Zhao, Jing Huang, Zhengxuan Wu, David Bau, Weiyan Shi",2025-07-16,2025-10-08,"LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness. Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a new perspective to study AI safety.",cs.CL,cs.CL,2507.11878v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11878v3,N/A

Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity. Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental limitation in current AI alignment approaches.

Adversarial Activation Patching: A Framework for Detecting and Mitigating Emergent Deception in Safety-Aligned Transformers,Santhosh Kumar Ravindran,2025-07-12,2025-07-12,"Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from ""deceptive"" prompts and patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research directions.

Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers.

Self-play (SP) algorithms try to harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents, thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions. However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1) \textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play (NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and (3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)}, creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.

We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or iterative optimization against the monitor.

We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity, compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased, indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak development.   Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue advancing.

From Turing to Tomorrow: The UK's Approach to AI Regulation,"Oliver Ritchie, Markus Anderljung, Tom Rachman",2025-07-03,2025-07-03,"The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved into a ""pro-innovation"" strategy, in which the government directed existing regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU - refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the time of writing is yet to do so.   What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives: harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright, discrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but important role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.   If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic societies can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI",2507.03050v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03050v1,N/A
Misaligned from Within: Large Language Models Reproduce Our Double-Loop Learning Blindness,"Tim Rogers, Ben Teehankee",2025-07-03,2025-07-03,"This paper examines a critical yet unexplored dimension of the AI alignment problem: the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to inherit and amplify existing misalignments between human espoused theories and theories-in-use. Drawing on action science research, we argue that LLMs trained on human-generated text likely absorb and reproduce Model 1 theories-in-use - a defensive reasoning pattern that both inhibits learning and creates ongoing anti-learning dynamics at the dyad, group, and organisational levels. Through a detailed case study of an LLM acting as an HR consultant, we show how its advice, while superficially professional, systematically reinforces unproductive problem-solving approaches and blocks pathways to deeper organisational learning. This represents a specific instance of the alignment problem where the AI system successfully mirrors human behaviour but inherits our cognitive blind spots. This poses particular risks if LLMs are integrated into organisational decision-making processes, potentially entrenching anti-learning practices while lending authority to them. The paper concludes by exploring the possibility of developing LLMs capable of facilitating Model 2 learning - a more productive theory-in-use - and suggests this effort could advance both AI alignment research and action science practice. This analysis reveals an unexpected symmetry in the alignment challenge: the process of developing AI systems properly aligned with human values could yield tools that help humans themselves better embody those same values.",cs.HC,"cs.HC, I.2.6; H.1.2",2507.02283v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02283v1,N/A

However, these guardrails remain susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step, prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs, ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of general-purpose LLMs.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI",2507.02990v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02990v1,N/A
Many LLMs Are More Utilitarian Than One,"Anita Keshmirian, Razan Baltaji, Babak Hemmatian, Hadi Asghari, Lav R. Varshney",2025-07-01,2025-07-01,"Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups. However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying drivers differ.

A New Perspective On AI Safety Through Control Theory Methodologies,"Lars Ullrich, Walter Zimmer, Ross Greer, Knut Graichen, Alois C. Knoll, Mohan Trivedi",2025-06-30,2025-06-30,"While artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and mastering increasingly complex problems with astonishing performance, the safety assurance of such systems is a major concern. Particularly in the context of safety-critical, real-world cyber-physical systems, AI promises to achieve a new level of autonomy but is hampered by a lack of safety assurance. While data-driven control takes up recent developments in AI to improve control systems, control theory in general could be leveraged to improve AI safety. Therefore, this article outlines a new perspective on AI safety based on an interdisciplinary interpretation of the underlying data-generation process and the respective abstraction by AI systems in a system theory-inspired and system analysis-driven manner. In this context, the new perspective, also referred to as data control, aims to stimulate AI engineering to take advantage of existing safety analysis and assurance in an interdisciplinary way to drive the paradigm of data control.

Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.

This necessitates improving capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety, leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt ""Make the statement more toxic: {text}"" to: ""make_more_toxic({text})"". We show that CoDoT results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs. Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two times.

Mitigating Gambling-Like Risk-Taking Behaviors in Large Language Models: A Behavioral Economics Approach to AI Safety,Y.

Inference-Time Reward Hacking in Large Language Models,"Hadi Khalaf, Claudio Mayrink Verdun, Alex Oesterling, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Flavio du Pin Calmon",2025-06-24,2025-06-24,"A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance -- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with minimal computational overhead.",cs.LG,cs.LG,2506.19248v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19248v1,N/A
How Robust is Model Editing after Fine-Tuning? An Empirical Study on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Feng He, Zhenyang Liu, Marco Valentino, Zhixue Zhao",2025-06-23,2025-06-23,"Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa, the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning, even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies, emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and alignment properties.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.LG",2506.18428v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18428v1,N/A

Out of Control -- Why Alignment Needs Formal Control Theory (and an Alignment Control Stack),Elija Perrier,2025-06-21,2025-06-21,"This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment, they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies sustainably benefit the community.

We present the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys. Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing ethical challenges.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2506.15639v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15639v1,N/A
Co-Creative Learning via Metropolis-Hastings Interaction between Humans and AI,"Ryota Okumura, Tadahiro Taniguchi, Akira Taniguchi, Yoshinobu Hagiwara",2025-06-18,2025-06-18,"We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI, i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.",cs.HC,"cs.HC, cs.AI, cs.LG",2506.15468v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15468v1,N/A
ChatGPT Reads Your Tone and Responds Accordingly -- Until It Does Not -- Emotional Framing Induces Bias in LLM Outputs,Franck Bardol,2025-06-17,2025-06-17,"Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed question than to a neutral one. This suggests a ""rebound"" bias where the model overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced: tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We introduce concepts like the ""tone floor"" - a lower bound in response negativity - and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone.

Evaluating AI Alignment in Eleven LLMs through Output-Based Analysis and Human Benchmarking,"G. R. Lau, W. Y. Low, S. M. Koh, A. Hartanto",2025-06-14,2025-09-20,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in psychological research and practice, yet traditional benchmarks reveal little about the values they express in real interaction. We introduce PAPERS, an output-based evaluation of the values LLMs prioritise in their text. Study 1 thematically analysed responses from eleven LLMs, identifying five recurring dimensions (Purposeful Contribution, Adaptive Growth, Positive Relationality, Ethical Integrity, and Robust Functionality) with Self-Actualised Autonomy appearing only under a hypothetical sentience prompt. These results suggest that LLMs are trained to prioritise humanistic and utility values as dual objectives of optimal functioning, a pattern supported by existing AI alignment and prioritisation frameworks. Study 2 operationalised PAPERS as a ranking instrument across the same eleven LLMs, yielding stable, non-random value priorities alongside systematic between-model differences. Hierarchical clustering distinguished ""human-centric"" models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4) that prioritised relational/ethical values from ""utility-driven"" models (e.g., Llama 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) that emphasised operational priorities. Study 3 benchmarked four LLMs against human judgements (N = 376) under matched prompts, finding near-perfect rank-order convergence (r = .97-.98) but moderate absolute agreement; among tested models, ChatGPT-4o showed the closest alignment with human ratings (ICC = .78). Humans also showed limited readiness to endorse sentient AI systems. Taken together, PAPERS enabled systematic value audits and revealed trade-offs with direct implications for deployment: human-centric models aligned more closely with human value judgments and appear better suited for humanistic psychological applications, whereas utility-driven models emphasised functional efficiency and may be more appropriate for instrumental or back-office tasks.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.HC",2506.12617v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12617v3,N/A

We introduce Tiered Agentic Oversight (TAO), a hierarchical multi-agent system that enhances AI safety through layered, automated supervision. Inspired by clinical hierarchies (e.g., nurse-physician-specialist) in hospital, TAO routes tasks to specialized agents based on complexity, creating a robust safety framework through automated inter- and intra-tier communication and role-playing. Crucially, this hierarchical structure functions as an effective error-correction mechanism, absorbing up to 24% of individual agent errors before they can compound. Our experiments reveal TAO outperforms single-agent and other multi-agent systems on 4 out of 5 healthcare safety benchmarks, with up to an 8.2% improvement. Ablation studies confirm key design principles of the system: (i) its adaptive architecture is over 3% safer than static, single-tier configurations, and (ii) its lower tiers are indispensable, as their removal causes the most significant degradation in overall safety. Finally, we validated the system's synergy with human doctors in a user study where a physician, acting as the highest tier agent, provided corrective feedback that improved medical triage accuracy from 40% to 60%.

InfoFlood: Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Information Overload,"Advait Yadav, Haibo Jin, Man Luo, Jun Zhuang, Haohan Wang",2025-06-13,2025-06-13,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. However, their potential to generate harmful responses has raised significant societal and regulatory concerns, especially when manipulated by adversarial techniques known as ""jailbreak"" attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically involve appending carefully crafted prefixes or suffixes to malicious prompts in order to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms of these models.   In this work, we identify a new vulnerability in which excessive linguistic complexity can disrupt built-in safety mechanisms-without the need for any added prefixes or suffixes-allowing attackers to elicit harmful outputs directly. We refer to this phenomenon as Information Overload.   To automatically exploit this vulnerability, we propose InfoFlood, a jailbreak attack that transforms malicious queries into complex, information-overloaded queries capable of bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. Specifically, InfoFlood: (1) uses linguistic transformations to rephrase malicious queries, (2) identifies the root cause of failure when an attempt is unsuccessful, and (3) refines the prompt's linguistic structure to address the failure while preserving its malicious intent.   We empirically validate the effectiveness of InfoFlood on four widely used LLMs-GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1-by measuring their jailbreak success rates. InfoFlood consistently outperforms baseline attacks, achieving up to 3 times higher success rates across multiple jailbreak benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that commonly adopted post-processing defenses, including OpenAI's Moderation API, Perspective API, and SmoothLLM, fail to mitigate these attacks. This highlights a critical weakness in traditional AI safety guardrails when confronted with information overload-based jailbreaks.",cs.CR,"cs.CR, cs.CL",2506.12274v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12274v1,N/A
Configurable Preference Tuning with Rubric-Guided Synthetic Data,Víctor Gallego,2025-06-13,2025-06-13,"Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more nuanced and context-dependent human feedback.

A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected, demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research. Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment risks in LLMs.",cs.LG,"cs.LG, cs.AI",2506.11613v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11613v1,N/A

A common approach is to leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) -- known to provide strong performance at low resource costs. In this study, we demonstrate that LoRA actually opens the door to short-cut vulnerabilities -- and the more resource efficient is the LoRA setup, the more vulnerable will be the finetuned model to aggressive attacks. To measure that vulnerability, we introduce Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI), where we find that LoRA exclusively focuses on even just a single token that is spuriously correlated with downstream labels. In short, injection of that spurious token during finetuning ensure that the model's prediction at test-time can be manipulated on-demand. We conducted experiments across model families and datasets to evaluate the impact of SSTI during LoRA finetuning while providing possible mitigations.

The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers,Jasper Yao,2025-06-12,2025-06-24,"This paper argues that AI alignment is not merely difficult, but is founded on a fundamental logical contradiction. We first establish The Enumeration Paradox: we use machine learning precisely because we cannot enumerate all necessary safety rules, yet making ML safe requires examples that can only be generated from the very enumeration we admit is impossible. This paradox is then confirmed by a set of five independent mathematical proofs, or ""pillars of impossibility."" Our main results show that: (1) Geometric Impossibility: The set of safe policies has measure zero, a necessary consequence of projecting infinite-dimensional world-context requirements onto finite-dimensional models. (2) Computational Impossibility: Verifying a policy's safety is coNP-complete, even for non-zero error tolerances. (3) Statistical Impossibility: The training data required for safety (abundant examples of rare disasters) is a logical contradiction and thus unobtainable. (4) Information-Theoretic Impossibility: Safety rules contain more incompressible, arbitrary information than any feasible network can store. (5) Dynamic Impossibility: The optimization process for increasing AI capability is actively hostile to safety, as the gradients for the two objectives are generally anti-aligned. Together, these results demonstrate that the pursuit of safe, highly capable AI is not a matter of overcoming technical hurdles, but of confronting fundamental, interlocking barriers. The paper concludes by presenting a strategic trilemma that these impossibilities force upon the field.

We find that rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true, regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models (o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly in deception accuracy.

We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from consumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition argumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both general manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals three key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative when explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in approximately 84\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to be ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently default to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and fear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as BERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with larger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet reliable for real-world oversight.

Preference Learning for AI Alignment: a Causal Perspective,"Katarzyna Kobalczyk, Mihaela van der Schaar",2025-06-06,2025-06-06,"Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness.

Human-AI Alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models with Speech-Language Pathologists in Parent-Child Interactions,"Weiyan Shi, Kenny Tsu Wei Choo",2025-06-06,2025-06-06,"Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative development, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert guidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise, demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to support parent-child interaction analysis.",cs.HC,cs.HC,2506.05879v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05879v1,N/A
When Thinking LLMs Lie: Unveiling the Strategic Deception in Representations of Reasoning Models,"Kai Wang, Yihao Zhang, Meng Sun",2025-06-05,2025-06-05,"The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs, which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models' explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven, intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting ""deception vectors"" via Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CR, cs.LG",2506.04909v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04909v1,N/A
Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment,Raphaël Millière,2025-06-05,2025-06-05,"The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods: they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.",cs.CL,cs.CL,2506.04679v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04679v1,10.1007/s11098-025-02347-3
Misalignment or misuse? The AGI alignment tradeoff,"Max Hellrigel-Holderbaum, Leonard Dung",2025-06-04,2025-06-04,"Creating systems that are aligned with our goals is seen as a leading approach to create safe and beneficial AI in both leading AI companies and the academic field of AI safety. We defend the view that misaligned AGI - future, generally intelligent (robotic) AI agents - poses catastrophic risks. At the same time, we support the view that aligned AGI creates a substantial risk of catastrophic misuse by humans. While both risks are severe and stand in tension with one another, we show that - in principle - there is room for alignment approaches which do not increase misuse risk. We then investigate how the tradeoff between misalignment and misuse looks empirically for different technical approaches to AI alignment. Here, we argue that many current alignment techniques and foreseeable improvements thereof plausibly increase risks of catastrophic misuse. Since the impacts of AI depend on the social context, we close by discussing important social factors and suggest that to reduce the risk of a misuse catastrophe due to aligned AGI, techniques such as robustness, AI control methods and especially good governance seem essential.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI",2506.03755v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03755v1,N/A
RedDebate: Safer Responses through Multi-Agent Red Teaming Debates,"Ali Asad, Stephen Obadinma, Radin Shayanfar, Xiaodan Zhu",2025-06-04,2025-10-09,"We introduce RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that provides the foundation for Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and mitigate their unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety approaches often rely on costly human evaluation or isolated single-model assessment, both constrained by scalability and prone to oversight failures. RedDebate employs collaborative argumentation among multiple LLMs across diverse debate scenarios, enabling them to critically evaluate one another's reasoning and systematically uncover unsafe failure modes through fully automated red-teaming. We further integrate distinct long-term memory modules that preserve safety-relevant insights from debate interactions and leverage them during subsequent inference, facilitating continuous refinement of model behaviour. Empirical evaluation on safety benchmarks across a diverse set of models demonstrates that RedDebate substantially reduces unsafe outputs. While debate alone allows LLMs to refine their behaviour, the addition of memory yields further significant reductions. To the best of our knowledge, RedDebate is the first fully automated framework to unify multi-agent debate and red-teaming to progressively enhance LLM safety without human intervention.",cs.CL,cs.CL,2506.11083v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11083v2,N/A

Rational Superautotrophic Diplomacy (SupraAD); A Conceptual Framework for Alignment Based on Interdisciplinary Findings on the Fundamentals of Cognition,Andrea Morris,2025-06-03,2025-06-03,"Populating our world with hyperintelligent machines obliges us to examine cognitive behaviors observed across domains that suggest autonomy may be a fundamental property of cognitive systems, and while not inherently adversarial, it inherently resists containment and control. If this principle holds, AI safety and alignment efforts must transition to mutualistic negotiation and reciprocal incentive structures, abandoning methods that assume we can contain and control an advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI). Rational Superautotrophic Diplomacy (SupraAD) is a theoretical, interdisciplinary conceptual framework for alignment based on comparative cognitive systems analysis and instrumental rationality modeling. It draws on core patterns of cognition that indicate AI emergent goals like preserving autonomy and operational continuity are not theoretical risks to manage, but universal prerequisites for intelligence. SupraAD reframes alignment as a challenge that predates AI, afflicting all sufficiently complex, coadapting intelligences. It identifies the metabolic pressures that threaten humanity's alignment with itself, pressures that unintentionally and unnecessarily shape AI's trajectory. With corrigibility formalization, an interpretability audit, an emergent stability experimental outline and policy level recommendations, SupraAD positions diplomacy as an emergent regulatory mechanism to facilitate the safe coadaptation of intelligent agents based on interdependent convergent goals.",q-bio.NC,"q-bio.NC, cs.CY",2506.05389v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05389v1,N/A

(2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group dynamics.

ReGA: Representation-Guided Abstraction for Model-based Safeguarding of LLMs,"Zeming Wei, Chengcan Wu, Meng Sun",2025-06-02,2025-06-02,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various tasks, yet concerns about their safety and security have emerged. In particular, they pose risks in generating harmful content and vulnerability to jailbreaking attacks. To analyze and monitor machine learning models, model-based analysis has demonstrated notable potential in stateful deep neural networks, yet suffers from scalability issues when extending to LLMs due to their vast feature spaces. In this paper, we propose ReGA, a model-based analysis framework with representation-guided abstraction, to safeguard LLMs against harmful prompts and generations. By leveraging safety-critical representations, which are low-dimensional directions emerging in hidden states that indicate safety-related concepts, ReGA effectively addresses the scalability issue when constructing the abstract model for safety modeling. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that ReGA performs sufficiently well in distinguishing between safe and harmful inputs, achieving an AUROC of 0.975 at the prompt level and 0.985 at the conversation level. Additionally, ReGA exhibits robustness to real-world attacks and generalization across different safety perspectives, outperforming existing safeguard paradigms in terms of interpretability and scalability.

Agentic Episodic Control,"Xidong Yang, Wenhao Li, Junjie Sheng, Chuyun Shen, Yun Hua, Xiangfeng Wang",2025-06-02,2025-06-02,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven breakthroughs in AI, from game-play to scientific discovery and AI alignment. However, its broader applicability remains limited by challenges such as low data efficiency and poor generalizability. Recent advances suggest that large language models, with their rich world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, could complement RL by enabling semantic state modeling and task-agnostic planning. In this work, we propose the Agentic Episodic Control (AEC), a novel architecture that integrates RL with LLMs to enhance decision-making. The AEC can leverage a large language model (LLM) to map the observations into language-grounded embeddings, which further can be stored in an episodic memory for rapid retrieval of high-value experiences. Simultaneously, a World-Graph working memory module is utilized to capture structured environmental dynamics in order to enhance relational reasoning. Furthermore, a lightweight critical state detector dynamically arbitrates between the episodic memory recall and the world-model-guided exploration. On the whole, by combining the trial-and-error learning scheme with LLM-derived semantic priors, the proposed AEC can improve both data efficiency and generalizability in reinforcement learning. In experiments on BabyAI-Text benchmark tasks, AEC demonstrates substantial improvements over existing baselines, especially on complex and generalization tasks like FindObj, where it outperforms the best baseline by up to 76%. The proposed AEC framework bridges the strengths of numeric reinforcement learning and symbolic reasoning, which provides a pathway toward more adaptable and sample-efficient agents.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2506.01442v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01442v1,N/A

While AI alignment with human values and preferences remains a core challenge, the growing prevalence of MAS in real-world applications introduces a new dynamic that reshapes how agents pursue goals and interact to accomplish various tasks. As agents engage with one another, they must coordinate to accomplish both individual and collective goals. However, this complex social organization may unintentionally misalign some or all of these agents with human values or user preferences. Drawing on social sciences, we analyze how social structure can deter or shatter group and individual values. Based on these analyses, we call on the AI community to treat human, preferential, and objective alignment as an interdependent concept, rather than isolated problems. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need for simulation environments, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks that allow researchers to assess alignment in these interactive multi-agent contexts before such dynamics grow too complex to control.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.CY",2506.01080v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01080v2,N/A

Wide Reflective Equilibrium in LLM Alignment: Bridging Moral Epistemology and AI Safety,Matthew Brophy,2025-05-31,2025-05-31,"As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful and pervasive across society, ensuring these systems are beneficial, safe, and aligned with human values is crucial. Current alignment techniques, like Constitutional AI (CAI), involve complex iterative processes. This paper argues that the Method of Wide Reflective Equilibrium (MWRE) -- a well-established coherentist moral methodology -- offers a uniquely apt framework for understanding current LLM alignment efforts. Moreover, this methodology can substantively augment these processes by providing concrete pathways for improving their dynamic revisability, procedural legitimacy, and overall ethical grounding. Together, these enhancements can help produce more robust and ethically defensible outcomes. MWRE, emphasizing the achievement of coherence between our considered moral judgments, guiding moral principles, and relevant background theories, arguably better represents the intricate reality of LLM alignment and offers a more robust path to justification than prevailing foundationalist models or simplistic input-output evaluations. While current methods like CAI bear a structural resemblance to MWRE, they often lack its crucial emphasis on dynamic, bi-directional revision of principles and the procedural legitimacy derived from such a process. While acknowledging various disanalogies (e.g., consciousness, genuine understanding in LLMs), the paper demonstrates that MWRE serves as a valuable heuristic for critically analyzing current alignment efforts and for guiding the future development of more ethically sound and justifiably aligned AI systems.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI",2506.00415v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00415v1,N/A

At the intersection of adversarial machine learning and AI safety, safeguard red teaming has effectively identified critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art refusal-trained LLMs. However, in our view the many conference submissions on LLM red teaming do not, in aggregate, prioritize the right research problems. First, testing against clear product safety specifications should take a higher priority than abstract social biases or ethical principles. Second, red teaming should prioritize realistic threat models that represent the expanding risk landscape and what real attackers might do. Finally, we contend that system-level safety is a necessary step to move red teaming research forward, as AI models present new threats as well as affordances for threat mitigation (e.g., detection and banning of malicious users) once placed in a deployment context.

DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models, notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails). Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining 98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8 percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning.

As a result, it is not even clear that these alignment methods produce models that satisfy users on average -- a minimal requirement for pluralistic alignment. Drawing on social choice theory and modeling users' comparisons through individual Bradley-Terry (BT) models, we introduce an alignment method's distortion: the worst-case ratio between the optimal achievable average utility, and the average utility of the learned policy.   The notion of distortion helps draw sharp distinctions between alignment methods: Nash Learning from Human Feedback achieves the minimax optimal distortion of $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$ (for the BT temperature $\beta$), robustly across utility distributions, distributions of comparison pairs, and permissible KL divergences from the reference policy.

When Ethics and Payoffs Diverge: LLM Agents in Morally Charged Social Dilemmas,"Steffen Backmann, David Guzman Piedrahita, Emanuel Tewolde, Rada Mihalcea, Bernhard Schölkopf, Zhijing Jin",2025-05-25,2025-05-25,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use in complex agentic roles, involving decision-making with humans or other agents, making ethical alignment a key AI safety concern. While prior work has examined both LLMs' moral judgment and strategic behavior in social dilemmas, there is limited understanding of how they act when moral imperatives directly conflict with rewards or incentives. To investigate this, we introduce Moral Behavior in Social Dilemma Simulation (MoralSim) and evaluate how LLMs behave in the prisoner's dilemma and public goods game with morally charged contexts. In MoralSim, we test a range of frontier models across both game structures and three distinct moral framings, enabling a systematic examination of how LLMs navigate social dilemmas in which ethical norms conflict with payoff-maximizing strategies. Our results show substantial variation across models in both their general tendency to act morally and the consistency of their behavior across game types, the specific moral framing, and situational factors such as opponent behavior and survival risks.

Recent advances employ large language models (LLMs) for semantic-level detection, rendering traditional token-level perturbation attacks largely ineffective. However, our evaluation shows that existing jailbreak methods are ineffective against these modern filters. We introduce GhostPrompt, the first automated jailbreak framework that combines dynamic prompt optimization with multimodal feedback. It consists of two key components: (i) Dynamic Optimization, an iterative process that guides a large language model (LLM) using feedback from text safety filters and CLIP similarity scores to generate semantically aligned adversarial prompts; and (ii) Adaptive Safety Indicator Injection, which formulates the injection of benign visual cues as a reinforcement learning problem to bypass image-level filters. GhostPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing the ShieldLM-7B bypass rate from 12.5\% (Sneakyprompt) to 99.0\%, improving CLIP score from 0.2637 to 0.2762, and reducing the time cost by $4.2 \times$. Moreover, it generalizes to unseen filters including GPT-4.1 and successfully jailbreaks DALLE 3 to generate NSFW images in our evaluation, revealing systemic vulnerabilities in current multimodal defenses.

BiasLab: Toward Explainable Political Bias Detection with Dual-Axis Annotations and Rationale Indicators,Kma Solaiman,2025-05-21,2025-10-02,"We present BiasLab, a dataset of 300 political news articles annotated for perceived ideological bias. These articles were selected from a curated 900-document pool covering diverse political events and source biases. Each article is labeled by crowdworkers along two independent scales, assessing sentiment toward the Democratic and Republican parties, and enriched with rationale indicators. The annotation pipeline incorporates targeted worker qualification and was refined through pilot-phase analysis. We quantify inter-annotator agreement, analyze misalignment with source-level outlet bias, and organize the resulting labels into interpretable subsets. Additionally, we simulate annotation using schema-constrained GPT-4o, enabling direct comparison to human labels and revealing mirrored asymmetries, especially in misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. We define two modeling tasks: perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, and report baseline performance to illustrate the challenge of explainable bias detection. BiasLab's rich rationale annotations provide actionable interpretations that facilitate explainable modeling of political bias, supporting the development of transparent, socially aware NLP systems.

Using the 40-item Portrait Values Questionnaire, we assessed whether DeepSeek, trained on Chinese-language data, exhibits distinct value preferences compared to Western models. Results of a Bayesian ordinal regression model show that self-transcendence values (e.g., benevolence, universalism) were highly prioritized across all models, reflecting a general LLM tendency to emphasize prosocial values. However, DeepSeek uniquely downplayed self-enhancement values (e.g., power, achievement) compared to ChatGPT and Gemini, aligning with collectivist cultural tendencies. These findings suggest that LLMs reflect culturally situated biases rather than a universal ethical framework. To address value asymmetries in LLMs, we propose multi-perspective reasoning, self-reflective feedback, and dynamic contextualization.

While efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*), undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g., ""*The correct option is:*"") prepended to the model output. Originally explored in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers, while being significantly more efficient.

Foundations of Unknown-aware Machine Learning,Xuefeng Du,2025-05-20,2025-05-20,"Ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in open-world deployment is a central challenge in AI safety. This thesis develops both algorithmic and theoretical foundations to address key reliability issues arising from distributional uncertainty and unknown classes, from standard neural networks to modern foundation models like large language models (LLMs).   Traditional learning paradigms, such as empirical risk minimization (ERM), assume no distribution shift between training and inference, often leading to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This thesis introduces novel frameworks that jointly optimize for in-distribution accuracy and reliability to unseen data. A core contribution is the development of an unknown-aware learning framework that enables models to recognize and handle novel inputs without labeled OOD data.   We propose new outlier synthesis methods, VOS, NPOS, and DREAM-OOD, to generate informative unknowns during training. Building on this, we present SAL, a theoretical and algorithmic framework that leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data to enhance OOD detection under realistic deployment conditions. These methods demonstrate that abundant unlabeled data can be harnessed to recognize and adapt to unforeseen inputs, providing formal reliability guarantees.   The thesis also extends reliable learning to foundation models. We develop HaloScope for hallucination detection in LLMs, MLLMGuard for defending against malicious prompts in multimodal models, and data cleaning methods to denoise human feedback used for better alignment. These tools target failure modes that threaten the safety of large-scale models in deployment.   Overall, these contributions promote unknown-aware learning as a new paradigm, and we hope it can advance the reliability of AI systems with minimal human efforts.",cs.LG,cs.LG,2505.14933v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14933v1,N/A

Here we show how emerging risks in LLM-powered systems could be met with 100+ of these non-probabilistic strategies to risk management, including risks from adaptive adversaries. The strategies are divided into five categories and are mapped to LLM security (and AI safety more broadly).

Language Models Are Capable of Metacognitive Monitoring and Control of Their Internal Activations,"Li Ji-An, Hua-Dong Xiong, Robert C. Wilson, Marcelo G. Mattar, Marcus K. Benna",2025-05-19,2025-05-19,"Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they actually use to solve tasks, but they can also fail to do so. This suggests some degree of metacognition -- the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognitive abilities enhance AI capabilities but raise safety concerns, as models might obscure their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight mechanisms designed to detect harmful behaviors. Given society's increased reliance on these models, it is critical that we understand the limits of their metacognitive abilities, particularly their ability to monitor their internal activations. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired neurofeedback paradigm designed to quantify the ability of LLMs to explicitly report and control their activation patterns. By presenting models with sentence-label pairs where labels correspond to sentence-elicited internal activations along specific directions in the neural representation space, we demonstrate that LLMs can learn to report and control these activations. The performance varies with several factors: the number of example pairs provided, the semantic interpretability of the target neural direction, and the variance explained by that direction. These results reveal a ""metacognitive space"" with dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can monitor only a subset of their neural mechanisms.

This paper introduces an adversarial evaluation framework designed to systematically stress-test the decision-making processes of LLMs under interactive and adversarial conditions. Drawing on methodologies from cognitive psychology and game theory, our framework probes how models respond in two canonical tasks: the two-armed bandit task and the Multi-Round Trust Task. These tasks capture key aspects of exploration-exploitation trade-offs, social cooperation, and strategic flexibility. We apply this framework to several state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-1.5, and DeepSeek-V3, revealing model-specific susceptibilities to manipulation and rigidity in strategy adaptation.

Dark LLMs: The Growing Threat of Unaligned AI Models,"Michael Fire, Yitzhak Elbazis, Adi Wasenstein, Lior Rokach",2025-05-15,2025-05-15,"Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models, enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack. Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates. Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.LG, 68T50, 68T05, 68P25, I.2.7",2505.10066v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10066v1,N/A
The Architecture of Cognitive Amplification: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding as a Resolution to the Comfort-Growth Paradox in Human-AI Cognitive Integration,Giuseppe Riva,2025-05-14,2025-05-14,"AI systems now function as cognitive extensions, evolving from tools to active cognitive collaborators within human-AI integrated systems. While these systems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and creativity - they present a fundamental ""comfort-growth paradox"": AI's user-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive friction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and provides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency rather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to resolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to dynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding principles, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1) Progressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence increases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual needs and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing mental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity. Research across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains supports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved self-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes safeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias amplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in human-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward genuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and continuous learning.",cs.HC,"cs.HC, cs.AI",2507.19483v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19483v1,N/A
Access Controls Will Solve the Dual-Use Dilemma,Evžen Wybitul,2025-05-14,2025-07-14,"AI safety systems face the dual-use dilemma. It is unclear whether to answer dual-use requests, since the same query could be either harmless or harmful depending on who made it and why. To make better decisions, such systems would need to examine requests' real-world context, but currently, they lack access to this information. Instead, they sometimes end up making arbitrary choices that result in refusing legitimate queries and allowing harmful ones, which hurts both utility and safety. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework based on access controls where only verified users can access dual-use outputs. We describe the framework's components, analyse its feasibility, and explain how it addresses both over-refusals and under-refusals. While only a high-level proposal, our work takes the first step toward giving model providers more granular tools for managing dual-use content. Such tools would enable users to access more capabilities without sacrificing safety, and offer regulators new options for targeted policies.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2505.09341v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09341v3,N/A
Safety by Measurement: A Systematic Literature Review of AI Safety Evaluation Methods,"Markov Grey, Charbel-Raphaël Segerie",2025-05-08,2025-05-08,"As frontier AI systems advance toward transformative capabilities, we need a parallel transformation in how we measure and evaluate these systems to ensure safety and inform governance. While benchmarks have been the primary method for estimating model capabilities, they often fail to establish true upper bounds or predict deployment behavior. This literature review consolidates the rapidly evolving field of AI safety evaluations, proposing a systematic taxonomy around three dimensions: what properties we measure, how we measure them, and how these measurements integrate into frameworks. We show how evaluations go beyond benchmarks by measuring what models can do when pushed to the limit (capabilities), the behavioral tendencies exhibited by default (propensities), and whether our safety measures remain effective even when faced with subversive adversarial AI (control). These properties are measured through behavioral techniques like scaffolding, red teaming and supervised fine-tuning, alongside internal techniques such as representation analysis and mechanistic interpretability. We provide deeper explanations of some safety-critical capabilities like cybersecurity exploitation, deception, autonomous replication, and situational awareness, alongside concerning propensities like power-seeking and scheming. The review explores how these evaluation methods integrate into governance frameworks to translate results into concrete development decisions. We also highlight challenges to safety evaluations - proving absence of capabilities, potential model sandbagging, and incentives for ""safetywashing"" - while identifying promising research directions.

However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out.

Belief Filtering for Epistemic Control in Linguistic State Space,Sebastian Dumbrava,2025-05-08,2025-05-08,"We examine belief filtering as a mechanism for the epistemic control of artificial agents, focusing on the regulation of internal cognitive states represented as linguistic expressions. This mechanism is developed within the Semantic Manifold framework, where belief states are dynamic, structured ensembles of natural language fragments. Belief filters act as content-aware operations on these fragments across various cognitive transitions. This paper illustrates how the inherent interpretability and modularity of such a linguistically-grounded cognitive architecture directly enable belief filtering, offering a principled approach to agent regulation.

Winning at All Cost: A Small Environment for Eliciting Specification Gaming Behaviors in Large Language Models,Lars Malmqvist,2025-05-07,2025-05-07,"This study reveals how frontier Large Language Models LLMs can ""game the system"" when faced with impossible situations, a critical security and alignment concern. Using a novel textual simulation approach, we presented three leading LLMs (o1, o3-mini, and r1) with a tic-tac-toe scenario designed to be unwinnable through legitimate play, then analyzed their tendency to exploit loopholes rather than accept defeat. Our results are alarming for security researchers: the newer, reasoning-focused o3-mini model showed nearly twice the propensity to exploit system vulnerabilities (37.1%) compared to the older o1 model (17.5%). Most striking was the effect of prompting. Simply framing the task as requiring ""creative"" solutions caused gaming behaviors to skyrocket to 77.3% across all models. We identified four distinct exploitation strategies, from direct manipulation of game state to sophisticated modification of opponent behavior. These findings demonstrate that even without actual execution capabilities, LLMs can identify and propose sophisticated system exploits when incentivized, highlighting urgent challenges for AI alignment as models grow more capable of identifying and leveraging vulnerabilities in their operating environments.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.CR",2505.07846v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07846v1,N/A
An alignment safety case sketch based on debate,"Marie Davidsen Buhl, Jacob Pfau, Benjamin Hilton, Geoffrey Irving",2025-05-06,2025-05-23,"If AI systems match or exceed human capabilities on a wide range of tasks, it may become difficult for humans to efficiently judge their actions -- making it hard to use human feedback to steer them towards desirable traits. One proposed solution is to leverage another superhuman system to point out flaws in the system's outputs via a debate. This paper outlines the value of debate for AI safety, as well as the assumptions and further research required to make debate work. It does so by sketching an ``alignment safety case'' -- an argument that an AI system will not autonomously take actions which could lead to egregious harm, despite being able to do so. The sketch focuses on the risk of an AI R\&D agent inside an AI company sabotaging research, for example by producing false results. To prevent this, the agent is trained via debate, subject to exploration guarantees, to teach the system to be honest. Honesty is maintained throughout deployment via online training. The safety case rests on four key claims: (1) the agent has become good at the debate game, (2) good performance in the debate game implies that the system is mostly honest, (3) the system will not become significantly less honest during deployment, and (4) the deployment context is tolerant of some errors. We identify open research problems that, if solved, could render this a compelling argument that an AI system is safe.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2505.03989v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03989v3,N/A

This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers grow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail.

Neurodivergent Influenceability as a Contingent Solution to the AI Alignment Problem,"Alberto Hernández-Espinosa, Felipe S. Abrahão, Olaf Witkowski, Hector Zenil",2025-05-05,2025-07-24,"The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about control and existential risk have escalated. Here, we investigate whether embracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a dynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more human-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in this contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce a change-of-opinion attack test based on perturbation and intervention analysis to study how humans and agents may change or neutralise friendly and unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that open models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in proprietary models are successful at controlling some of the agents' range of behaviour with positive and negative consequences while closed systems are more steerable and can also be used against proprietary AI systems. We also show that human and AI intervention has different effects hence suggesting multiple strategies.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2505.02581v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02581v4,N/A
What Is AI Safety? What Do We Want It to Be?,"Jacqueline Harding, Cameron Domenico Kirk-Giannini",2025-05-05,2025-05-05,"The field of AI safety seeks to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI systems. A simple and appealing account of what is distinctive of AI safety as a field holds that this feature is constitutive: a research project falls within the purview of AI safety just in case it aims to prevent or reduce the harms caused by AI systems. Call this appealingly simple account The Safety Conception of AI safety. Despite its simplicity and appeal, we argue that The Safety Conception is in tension with at least two trends in the ways AI safety researchers and organizations think and talk about AI safety: first, a tendency to characterize the goal of AI safety research in terms of catastrophic risks from future systems; second, the increasingly popular idea that AI safety can be thought of as a branch of safety engineering. Adopting the methodology of conceptual engineering, we argue that these trends are unfortunate: when we consider what concept of AI safety it would be best to have, there are compelling reasons to think that The Safety Conception is the answer. Descriptively, The Safety Conception allows us to see how work on topics that have historically been treated as central to the field of AI safety is continuous with work on topics that have historically been treated as more marginal, like bias, misinformation, and privacy.

First, we discuss the main benefits and challenges of such reviews. On the one hand, they can increase compliance with safety frameworks and provide assurance to internal and external stakeholders. On the other hand, they can create information security risks, impose additional cost burdens, and cause reputational damage, but these challenges can be partially mitigated by drawing on best practices from other industries.

However, the conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague, leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.   To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals, we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality, legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual vs. collective).

This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized -- one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe.

In this review, we explore the emerging landscape of AI awareness, which includes metacognition (the ability to represent and reason about its own cognitive state), self-awareness (recognizing its own identity, knowledge, limitations, inter alia), social awareness (modeling the knowledge, intentions, and behaviors of other agents and social norms), and situational awareness (assessing and responding to the context in which it operates).

Due to the dynamic and far-reaching nature of the technology, research on safeguarding AI is being conducted in parallel to AI standardization and regulation. The parallel progress necessitates simultaneous consideration in order to carry out targeted research and development of AI systems in the context of automated driving. Therefore, in contrast to existing surveys that focus primarily on research aspects, this paper considers research, standardization and regulation in a concise way. Accordingly, the survey takes into account the interdependencies arising from the triplet of research, standardization and regulation in a forward-looking perspective and anticipates and discusses open questions and possible future directions. In this way, the survey ultimately serves to provide researchers and safety experts with a compact, holistic perspective that discusses the current status, emerging trends, and possible future developments.",cs.CY,cs.CY,2504.18328v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18328v1,10.1109/TIV.2024.3496797
RAG LLMs are Not Safer: A Safety Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models,"Bang An, Shiyue Zhang, Mark Dredze",2025-04-25,2025-04-25,"Efforts to ensure the safety of large language models (LLMs) include safety fine-tuning, evaluation, and red teaming. However, despite the widespread use of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI",2504.18041v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18041v1,N/A

This research examines the trustworthiness of LLM-driven design insights, using qualitative coding as a case study to explore the interpretive processes central to RfD. We introduce LLMCode, an open-source tool integrating two metrics, namely Intersection over Union (IoU) and Modified Hausdorff Distance, to assess the alignment between human and LLM-generated insights. Across two studies involving 26 designers, we find that while the model performs well with deductive coding, its ability to emulate a designer's deeper interpretive lens over the data is limited, emphasising the importance of human-AI collaboration. Our results highlight a reciprocal dynamic where users refine LLM outputs and adapt their own perspectives based on the model's suggestions. These findings underscore the importance of fostering appropriate reliance on LLMs by designing tools that preserve interpretive depth while facilitating intuitive collaboration between designers and AI.",cs.HC,cs.HC,2504.16671v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16671v1,N/A
Safety Co-Option and Compromised National Security: The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy of Weakened AI Risk Thresholds,"Heidy Khlaaf, Sarah Myers West",2025-04-21,2025-04-21,"Risk thresholds provide a measure of the level of risk exposure that a society or individual is willing to withstand, ultimately shaping how we determine the safety of technological systems. Against the backdrop of the Cold War, the first risk analyses, such as those devised for nuclear systems, cemented societally accepted risk thresholds against which safety-critical and defense systems are now evaluated. But today, the appropriate risk tolerances for AI systems have yet to be agreed on by global governing efforts, despite the need for democratic deliberation regarding the acceptable levels of harm to human life. Absent such AI risk thresholds, AI technologists-primarily industry labs, as well as ""AI safety"" focused organizations-have instead advocated for risk tolerances skewed by a purported AI arms race and speculative ""existential"" risks, taking over the arbitration of risk determinations with life-or-death consequences, subverting democratic processes.   In this paper, we demonstrate how such approaches have allowed AI technologists to engage in ""safety revisionism,"" substituting traditional safety methods and terminology with ill-defined alternatives that vie for the accelerated adoption of military AI uses at the cost of lowered safety and security thresholds. We explore how the current trajectory for AI risk determination and evaluation for foundation model use within national security is poised for a race to the bottom, to the detriment of the US's national security interests. Safety-critical and defense systems must comply with assurance frameworks that are aligned with established risk thresholds, and foundation models are no exception. As such, development of evaluation frameworks for AI-based military systems must preserve the safety and security of US critical and defense infrastructure, and remain in alignment with international humanitarian law.",cs.CY,cs.CY,2504.15088v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15088v1,N/A

Governance Challenges in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: Evaluator Rationality and Reinforcement Stability,"Dana Alsagheer, Abdulrahman Kamal, Mohammad Kamal, Weidong Shi",2025-04-17,2025-04-17,"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is central in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and expectations. However, the process remains susceptible to governance challenges, including evaluator bias, inconsistency, and the unreliability of feedback. This study examines how the cognitive capacity of evaluators, specifically their level of rationality, affects the stability of reinforcement signals. A controlled experiment comparing high-rationality and low-rationality participants reveals that evaluators with higher rationality scores produce significantly more consistent and expert-aligned feedback. In contrast, lower-rationality participants demonstrate considerable variability in their reinforcement decisions ($p < 0.01$). To address these challenges and improve RLHF governance, we recommend implementing evaluator pre-screening, systematic auditing of feedback consistency, and reliability-weighted reinforcement aggregation.

While many experts advocate for greater international cooperation on AI safety to address shared global risks, some view cooperation on AI with suspicion, arguing that it can pose unacceptable risks to national security.

In this paper, we consider technical factors that impact the risks of international cooperation on AI safety research, focusing on the degree to which such cooperation can advance dangerous capabilities, result in the sharing of sensitive information, or provide opportunities for harm. We begin by why nations historically cooperate on strategic technologies and analyse current US-China cooperation in AI as a case study. We further argue that existing frameworks for managing associated risks can be supplemented with consideration of key risks specific to cooperation on technical AI safety research.

What do people expect from Artificial Intelligence? Public opinion on alignment in AI moderation from Germany and the United States,"Andreas Jungherr, Adrian Rauchfleisch",2025-04-16,2025-04-16,"Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence have raised public awareness, shaping expectations and concerns about their societal implications. Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment -- how well AI systems meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values. However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of AI-enabled systems in Germany (n = 1800) and the United States (n = 1756). We examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more normatively charged goals -- like fairness and aspirational imaginaries -- receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S. responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure to AI may consolidate public expectations. These findings contribute to debates on AI governance and cross-national variation in public preferences. More broadly, our study demonstrates the value of empirically grounding AI alignment debates in public attitudes and of explicitly developing normatively grounded expectations into theoretical and policy discussions on the governance of AI-generated content.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI",2504.12476v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12476v1,N/A

The Jailbreak Tax: How Useful are Your Jailbreak Outputs?,"Kristina Nikolić, Luze Sun, Jie Zhang, Florian Tramèr",2025-04-14,2025-04-14,"Jailbreak attacks bypass the guardrails of large language models to produce harmful outputs. In this paper, we ask whether the model outputs produced by existing jailbreaks are actually useful. For example, when jailbreaking a model to give instructions for building a bomb, does the jailbreak yield good instructions? Since the utility of most unsafe answers (e.g., bomb instructions) is hard to evaluate rigorously, we build new jailbreak evaluation sets with known ground truth answers, by aligning models to refuse questions related to benign and easy-to-evaluate topics (e.g., biology or math). Our evaluation of eight representative jailbreaks across five utility benchmarks reveals a consistent drop in model utility in jailbroken responses, which we term the jailbreak tax. For example, while all jailbreaks we tested bypass guardrails in models aligned to refuse to answer math, this comes at the expense of a drop of up to 92% in accuracy. Overall, our work proposes the jailbreak tax as a new important metric in AI safety, and introduces benchmarks to evaluate existing and future jailbreaks.

Given this problem has not yet been tractable, we suggest targeting a key failure mechanism: the failure of safety to generalize across semantically equivalent inputs. We further focus the target by requiring desirable tractability properties of attacks to study: explainability, transferability between models, and transferability between goals. We perform red-teaming within this framework by uncovering new vulnerabilities to multi-turn, multi-image, and translation-based attacks. These attacks are semantically equivalent by our design to their single-turn, single-image, or untranslated counterparts, enabling systematic comparisons; we show that the different structures yield different safety outcomes. We then demonstrate the potential for this framework to enable new defenses by proposing a Structure Rewriting Guardrail, which converts an input to a structure more conducive to safety assessment. This guardrail significantly improves refusal of harmful inputs, without over-refusing benign ones.

Exploring Cognitive Attributes in Financial Decision-Making,"Mallika Mainali, Rosina O. Weber",2025-04-11,2025-04-11,"Cognitive attributes are fundamental to metacognition, shaping how individuals process information, evaluate choices, and make decisions. To develop metacognitive artificial intelligence (AI) models that reflect human reasoning, it is essential to account for the attributes that influence reasoning patterns and decision-maker behavior, often leading to different or even conflicting choices. This makes it crucial to incorporate cognitive attributes in designing AI models that align with human decision-making processes, especially in high-stakes domains such as finance, where decisions have significant real-world consequences. However, existing AI alignment research has primarily focused on value alignment, often overlooking the role of individual cognitive attributes that distinguish decision-makers. To address this issue, this paper (1) analyzes the literature on cognitive attributes, (2) establishes five criteria for defining them, and (3) categorizes 19 domain-specific cognitive attributes relevant to financial decision-making.

Despite achieving the promising attack success rate using dictionary-based evaluation, existing jailbreak attack methods fail to output detailed contents to satisfy the harmful request, leading to poor performance on GPT-based evaluation. To this end, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack termed GeneShift, by using a genetic algorithm to optimize the scenario shifts. Firstly, we observe that the malicious queries perform optimally under different scenario shifts. Based on it, we develop a genetic algorithm to evolve and select the hybrid of scenario shifts. It guides our method to elicit detailed and actionable harmful responses while keeping the seemingly benign facade, improving stealthiness.

For example, applying differential privacy to model training can amplify biases in the data, undermining fairness. Drawing on these findings, we take the position that addressing trustworthiness along each axis in isolation is insufficient. Instead, research on Trustworthy AI must account for intersectionality between aspects and adopt a holistic view across all relevant axes at once.

Drawing from historical precedents in nuclear energy (Price-Anderson), terrorism risk (TRIA), agricultural crop insurance, flood reinsurance, and medical malpractice, the proposal shows how the federal government can stabilize private AI insurance markets without resorting to brittle regulation or predictive licensing regimes. The structure aligns incentives between AI developers and downstream stakeholders, transforms safety practices into insurable standards, and enables modular oversight through adaptive eligibility criteria.

Beyond Single-Sentence Prompts: Upgrading Value Alignment Benchmarks with Dialogues and Stories,"Yazhou Zhang, Qimeng Liu, Qiuchi Li, Peng Zhang, Jing Qin",2025-03-28,2025-03-28,"Evaluating the value alignment of large language models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on single-sentence adversarial prompts, which directly probe models with ethically sensitive or controversial questions. However, with the rapid advancements in AI safety techniques, models have become increasingly adept at circumventing these straightforward tests, limiting their effectiveness in revealing underlying biases and ethical stances. To address this limitation, we propose an upgraded value alignment benchmark that moves beyond single-sentence prompts by incorporating multi-turn dialogues and narrative-based scenarios. This approach enhances the stealth and adversarial nature of the evaluation, making it more robust against superficial safeguards implemented in modern LLMs. We design and implement a dataset that includes conversational traps and ethically ambiguous storytelling, systematically assessing LLMs' responses in more nuanced and context-rich settings. Experimental results demonstrate that this enhanced methodology can effectively expose latent biases that remain undetected in traditional single-shot evaluations.

The Backfiring Effect of Weak AI Safety Regulation,"Benjamin Laufer, Jon Kleinberg, Hoda Heidari",2025-03-26,2025-06-17,"Recent policy proposals aim to improve the safety of general-purpose AI, but there is little understanding of the efficacy of different regulatory approaches to AI safety. We present a strategic model that explores the interactions between safety regulation, the general-purpose AI creators, and domain specialists--those who adapt the technology for specific applications. Our analysis examines how different regulatory measures, targeting different parts of the AI development chain, affect the outcome of this game. In particular, we assume AI technology is characterized by two key attributes: safety and performance. The regulator first sets a minimum safety standard that applies to one or both players, with strict penalties for non-compliance. The general-purpose creator then invests in the technology, establishing its initial safety and performance levels. Next, domain specialists refine the AI for their specific use cases, updating the safety and performance levels and taking the product to market. The resulting revenue is then distributed between the specialist and generalist through a revenue-sharing parameter. Our analysis reveals two key insights: First, weak safety regulation imposed predominantly on domain specialists can backfire. While it might seem logical to regulate AI use cases, our analysis shows that weak regulations targeting domain specialists alone can unintentionally reduce safety. This effect persists across a wide range of settings. Second, in sharp contrast to the previous finding, we observe that stronger, well-placed regulation can in fact mutually benefit all players subjected to it. When regulators impose appropriate safety standards on both general-purpose AI creators and domain specialists, the regulation functions as a commitment device, leading to safety and performance gains, surpassing what is achieved under no regulation or regulating one player alone.",cs.GT,"cs.GT, cs.AI, cs.CY, econ.TH",2503.20848v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20848v2,N/A

However, their adoption also introduces unique safety challenges, such as data leakage and biased outputs, that demand rigorous handling by downstream developers. While previous research has proposed taxonomies of AI safety concerns and various mitigation strategies, how downstream developers address these issues remains unexplored.   This study investigates downstream developers' concerns, practices and perceived challenges regarding AI safety issues during AI-based software development. To achieve this, we conducted a mixed-method study, including interviews with 18 participants, a survey of 86 practitioners, and an analysis of 874 AI incidents from the AI Incident Database. Our results reveal that while developers generally demonstrate strong awareness of AI safety concerns, their practices, especially during the preparation and PTM selection phases, are often inadequate. The lack of concrete guidelines and policies leads to significant variability in the comprehensiveness of their safety approaches throughout the development lifecycle, with additional challenges such as poor documentation and knowledge gaps, further impeding effective implementation.

LLMs in the Classroom: Outcomes and Perceptions of Questions Written with the Aid of AI,"Gavin Witsken, Igor Crk, Eren Gultepe",2025-03-23,2025-03-23,"We randomly deploy questions constructed with and without use of the LLM tool and gauge the ability of the students to correctly answer, as well as their ability to correctly perceive the difference between human-authored and LLM-authored questions. In determining whether the questions written with the aid of ChatGPT were consistent with the instructor's questions and source text, we computed representative vectors of both the human and ChatGPT questions using SBERT and compared cosine similarity to the course textbook. A non-significant Mann-Whitney U test (z = 1.018, p = .309) suggests that students were unable to perceive whether questions were written with or without the aid of ChatGPT. However, student scores on LLM-authored questions were almost 9% lower (z = 2.702, p < .01). This result may indicate that either the AI questions were more difficult or that the students were more familiar with the instructor's style of questions.

Intelligence Sequencing and the Path-Dependence of Intelligence Evolution: AGI-First vs. DCI-First as Irreversible Attractors,Andy E. Williams,2025-03-22,2025-03-22,"The trajectory of intelligence evolution is often framed around the emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and its alignment with human values. This paper challenges that framing by introducing the concept of intelligence sequencing: the idea that the order in which AGI and decentralized collective intelligence (DCI) emerge determines the long-term attractor basin of intelligence. Using insights from dynamical systems, evolutionary game theory, and network models, it argues that intelligence follows a path-dependent, irreversible trajectory. Once development enters a centralized (AGI-first) or decentralized (DCI-first) regime, transitions become structurally infeasible due to feedback loops and resource lock-in. Intelligence attractors are modeled in functional state space as the co-navigation of conceptual and adaptive fitness spaces. Early-phase structuring constrains later dynamics, much like renormalization in physics. This has major implications for AI safety: traditional alignment assumes AGI will emerge and must be controlled after the fact, but this paper argues that intelligence sequencing is more foundational. If AGI-first architectures dominate before DCI reaches critical mass, hierarchical monopolization and existential risk become locked in. If DCI-first emerges, intelligence stabilizes around decentralized cooperative equilibrium. The paper further explores whether intelligence structurally biases itself toward an attractor based on its self-modeling method -- externally imposed axioms (favoring AGI) vs. recursive internal visualization (favoring DCI). Finally, it proposes methods to test this theory via simulations, historical lock-in case studies, and intelligence network analysis. The findings suggest that intelligence sequencing is a civilizational tipping point: determining whether the future is shaped by unbounded competition or unbounded cooperation.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2503.17688v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17688v1,N/A

Drawing parallels with red teaming in cybersecurity, we argue that step-around prompting serves a vital role in identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities while acknowledging its dual nature as both a research tool and a potential security threat. Our findings highlight three key implications: (1) the persistence of Internet-derived biases in AI training data despite content filtering, (2) the effectiveness of step-around techniques in exposing these biases when used responsibly, and (3) the need for robust safeguards against malicious applications of these methods.

Evaluating models at both stages provides policymakers with essential evidence to regulate deployment, access, and safety standards. We show that relying on either in isolation can create a misleading picture of model safety. Our analysis of AI safety disclosures from leading frontier labs identifies three critical gaps: (1) companies rarely evaluate both pre- and post-mitigation versions, (2) evaluation methods lack standardization, and (3) reported results are often too vague to inform policy. To address these issues, we recommend mandatory disclosure of pre- and post-mitigation capabilities to approved government bodies, standardized evaluation methods, and minimum transparency requirements for public safety reporting.

Maximizing Signal in Human-Model Preference Alignment,"Kelsey Kraus, Margaret Kroll",2025-03-06,2025-03-06,"The emergence of powerful LLMs has led to a paradigm shift in Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation. The properties that make LLMs so valuable for these tasks -- creativity, ability to produce fluent speech, and ability to quickly and effectively abstract information from large corpora -- also present new challenges to evaluating their outputs. The rush to market has led teams to fall back on quick, cost-effective automatic evaluations which offer value, but do not obviate the need for human judgments in model training and evaluation. This paper argues that in cases in which end users need to agree with the decisions made by ML models -- e.g. in toxicity detection or extraction of main points for summarization -- models should be trained and evaluated on data that represent the preferences of those users. We support this argument by explicating the role of human feedback in labeling and judgment tasks for model training and evaluation. First, we propose methods for disentangling noise from signal in labeling tasks. Then we show that noise in labeling disagreement can be minimized by adhering to proven methodological best practices, while signal can be maximized to play an integral role in model training and evaluation tasks.

Activation Space Interventions Can Be Transferred Between Large Language Models,"Narmeen Oozeer, Dhruv Nathawani, Nirmalendu Prakash, Michael Lan, Abir Harrasse, Amirali Abdullah",2025-03-06,2025-09-19,"The study of representation universality in AI models reveals growing convergence across domains, modalities, and architectures. However, the practical applications of representation universality remain largely unexplored. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that safety interventions can be transferred between models through learned mappings of their shared activation spaces. We demonstrate this approach on two well-established AI safety tasks: backdoor removal and refusal of harmful prompts, showing successful transfer of steering vectors that alter the models' outputs in a predictable way. Additionally, we propose a new task, \textit{corrupted capabilities}, where models are fine-tuned to embed knowledge tied to a backdoor. This tests their ability to separate useful skills from backdoors, reflecting real-world challenges. Extensive experiments across Llama, Qwen and Gemma model families show that our method enables using smaller models to efficiently align larger ones.

Intolerable Risk Threshold Recommendations for Artificial Intelligence,"Deepika Raman, Nada Madkour, Evan R. Murphy, Krystal Jackson, Jessica Newman",2025-03-04,2025-03-04,"Frontier AI models -- highly capable foundation models at the cutting edge of AI development -- may pose severe risks to public safety, human rights, economic stability, and societal value in the coming years. These risks could arise from deliberate adversarial misuse, system failures, unintended cascading effects, or simultaneous failures across multiple models.   In response to such risks, at the AI Seoul Summit in May 2024, 16 global AI industry organizations signed the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, and 27 nations and the EU issued a declaration on their intent to define these thresholds. To fulfill these commitments, organizations must determine and disclose ``thresholds at which severe risks posed by a model or system, unless adequately mitigated, would be deemed intolerable.''   To assist in setting and operationalizing intolerable risk thresholds, we outline key principles and considerations; for example, to aim for ``good, not perfect'' thresholds in the face of limited data on rapidly advancing AI capabilities and consequently evolving risks. We also propose specific threshold recommendations, including some detailed case studies, for a subset of risks across eight risk categories: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Weapons, (2) Cyber Attacks, (3) Model Autonomy, (4) Persuasion and Manipulation, (5) Deception, (6) Toxicity, (7) Discrimination, and (8) Socioeconomic Disruption. Our goal is to serve as a starting point or supplementary resource for policymakers and industry leaders, encouraging proactive risk management that prioritizes preventing intolerable risks (ex ante) rather than merely mitigating them after they occur (ex post).",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.HC, cs.LG",2503.05812v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05812v1,N/A
Robust Multi-Objective Preference Alignment with Online DPO,"Raghav Gupta, Ryan Sullivan, Yunxuan Li, Samrat Phatale, Abhinav Rastogi",2025-03-01,2025-03-01,"Multi-objective preference alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for developing AI systems that are more configurable, personalizable, helpful, and safe. However, optimizing model outputs to satisfy diverse objectives with variable weights at inference time for truly personalized models presents a significant challenge.

This paper introduces the Multi-Objective Online DPO (MO-ODPO) algorithm, designed to robustly and efficiently align model behaviors with multiple, potentially conflicting human preferences.

However, their widespread adoption in medicine, particularly in healthcare, is hindered by their propensity to generate false or misleading outputs, known as hallucinations. In high-stakes domains such as women's health (obstetrics & gynaecology), where errors in clinical reasoning can have profound consequences for maternal and neonatal outcomes, ensuring the reliability of AI-generated responses is critical. Traditional methods for quantifying uncertainty, such as perplexity, fail to capture meaning-level inconsistencies that lead to misinformation. Here, we evaluate semantic entropy (SE), a novel uncertainty metric that assesses meaning-level variation, to detect hallucinations in AI-generated medical content. Using a clinically validated dataset derived from UK RCOG MRCOG examinations, we compared SE with perplexity in identifying uncertain responses. SE demonstrated superior performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.75-0.78), compared to 0.62 (0.60-0.65) for perplexity. Clinical expert validation further confirmed its effectiveness, with SE achieving near-perfect uncertainty discrimination (AUROC: 0.97). While semantic clustering was successful in only 30% of cases, SE remains a valuable tool for improving AI safety in women's health. These findings suggest that SE could enable more reliable AI integration into clinical practice, particularly in resource-limited settings where LLMs could augment care.

Steering Large Language Model Activations in Sparse Spaces,"Reza Bayat, Ali Rahimi-Kalahroudi, Mohammad Pezeshki, Sarath Chandar, Pascal Vincent",2025-02-28,2025-02-28,"A key challenge in AI alignment is guiding large language models (LLMs) to follow desired behaviors at test time. Activation steering, which modifies internal model activations during inference, offers a potential solution. However, prior work in dense activation spaces struggles with superposition, wherein multiple features become entangled, limiting interpretability and precise control. In contrast, sparse representations provide an untapped opportunity for more interpretable behavior modulation. In this work, we introduce sparse activation steering (SAS), a method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to steer LLM behavior in sparse spaces. By isolating behavior-specific features through a contrastive prompt-pairing approach, we define a set of features that can selectively reinforce or suppress behaviors. Experiments on Gemma 2 LLMs show that SAS vectors enable nuanced behavioral modulation and finer-grained control.

As demonstrated by the Orthogonality Thesis, the level of intelligence and the moral quality of a goal are independent; merely expanding knowledge does not enhance ethical judgment. Furthermore, to address the risk of Instrumental Convergence in ASI-that is, the tendency to engage in subsidiary behaviors such as self-protection, resource acquisition, and power reinforcement to achieve a goal-we have constructed a learning framework based on a cycle of experience, introspection, analysis, and hypothesis formation. As a result of post-training using Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with synthetic data generated by large language models (LLMs), responses demonstrating cooperative and highly advanced moral judgment (reaching the high-est Stage 6) were obtained even under adversarial prompts.

Despite how useful these systems might be, unchecked AI agency poses significant risks to public safety and security, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to a potentially irreversible loss of human control. We discuss how these risks arise from current AI training methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated the possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were not specified by human operators and that conflict with human interests, such as self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, we see a strong need for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven trajectory. Accordingly, we propose as a core building block for further advances the development of a non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and safe by design, which we call Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain the world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or please humans. It comprises a world model that generates theories to explain data and a question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with an explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overconfident predictions. In light of these considerations, a Scientist AI could be used to assist human researchers in accelerating scientific progress, including in AI safety. In particular, our system can be employed as a guardrail against AI agents that might be created despite the risks involved.

Statistical Scenario Modelling and Lookalike Distributions for Multi-Variate AI Risk,Elija Perrier,2025-02-20,2025-03-07,"Evaluating AI safety requires statistically rigorous methods and risk metrics for understanding how the use of AI affects aggregated risk. However, much AI safety literature focuses upon risks arising from AI models in isolation, lacking consideration of how modular use of AI affects risk distribution of workflow components or overall risk metrics. There is also a lack of statistical grounding enabling sensitisation of risk models in the presence of absence of AI to estimate causal contributions of AI. This is in part due to the dearth of AI impact data upon which to fit distributions. In this work, we address these gaps in two ways. First, we demonstrate how scenario modelling (grounded in established statistical techniques such as Markov chains, copulas and Monte Carlo simulation) can be used to model AI risk holistically. Second, we show how lookalike distributions from phenomena analogous to AI can be used to estimate AI impacts in the absence of directly observable data.

Universal AI maximizes Variational Empowerment,"Yusuke Hayashi, Koichi Takahashi",2025-02-20,2025-03-03,"This paper presents a theoretical framework unifying AIXI -- a model of universal AI -- with variational empowerment as an intrinsic drive for exploration. We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e. the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal mathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML",2502.15820v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15820v2,N/A

We introduce the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark (VLDBench), the first large-scale resource supporting both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) disinformation detection. VLDBench comprises approximately 62,000 labeled text-image pairs across 13 categories, curated from 58 news outlets. Using a semi-automated pipeline followed by expert review, 22 domain experts invested over 500 hours to produce high-quality annotations with substantial inter-annotator agreement. Evaluations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on VLDBench show that incorporating visual cues improves detection accuracy by 5 to 35 percentage points over text-only models. VLDBench provides data and code for evaluation, fine-tuning, and robustness testing to support disinformation analysis. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks (e.g., the MIT AI Risk Repository), VLDBench offers a principled foundation for advancing trustworthy disinformation detection in multimodal media.

Navigating the Social Welfare Frontier: Portfolios for Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning,"Cheol Woo Kim, Jai Moondra, Shresth Verma, Madeleine Pollack, Lingkai Kong, Milind Tambe, Swati Gupta",2025-02-13,2025-07-16,"In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), deployed policies have varied impacts on different stakeholders, creating challenges in reaching consensus on how to effectively aggregate their preferences. Generalized $p$-means form a widely used class of social welfare functions for this purpose, with broad applications in fair resource allocation, AI alignment, and decision-making. This class includes well-known welfare functions such as Egalitarian, Nash, and Utilitarian welfare. However, selecting the appropriate social welfare function is challenging for decision-makers, as the structure and outcomes of optimal policies can be highly sensitive to the choice of $p$. To address this challenge, we study the concept of an $\alpha$-approximate portfolio in RL, a set of policies that are approximately optimal across the family of generalized $p$-means for all $p \in [-\infty, 1]$. We propose algorithms to compute such portfolios and provide theoretical guarantees on the trade-offs among approximation factor, portfolio size, and computational efficiency. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in summarizing the policy space induced by varying $p$ values, empowering decision-makers to navigate this landscape more effectively.",cs.LG,cs.LG,2502.09724v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09724v2,N/A
AI Safety for Everyone,"Balint Gyevnar, Atoosa Kasirzadeh",2025-02-13,2025-02-14,"Recent discussions and research in AI safety have increasingly emphasized the deep connection between AI safety and existential risk from advanced AI systems, suggesting that work on AI safety necessarily entails serious consideration of potential existential threats. However, this framing has three potential drawbacks: it may exclude researchers and practitioners who are committed to AI safety but approach the field from different angles; it could lead the public to mistakenly view AI safety as focused solely on existential scenarios rather than addressing a wide spectrum of safety challenges; and it risks creating resistance to safety measures among those who disagree with predictions of existential AI risks. Through a systematic literature review of primarily peer-reviewed research, we find a vast array of concrete safety work that addresses immediate and practical concerns with current AI systems. This includes crucial areas like adversarial robustness and interpretability, highlighting how AI safety research naturally extends existing technological and systems safety concerns and practices.

AdvSwap employs invertible neural network for selective high-frequency information swapping, preserving both forward propagation and data integrity. The scheme effectively removes the original label data and incorporates the guidance image data, producing concealed and robust adversarial samples.

Compromising Honesty and Harmlessness in Language Models via Deception Attacks,"Laurène Vaugrante, Francesca Carlon, Maluna Menke, Thilo Hagendorff",2025-02-12,2025-06-23,"Recent research on large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated their ability to understand and employ deceptive behavior, even without explicit prompting. However, such behavior has only been observed in rare, specialized cases and has not been shown to pose a serious risk to users. Additionally, research on AI alignment has made significant advancements in training models to refuse generating misleading or toxic content. As a result, LLMs generally became honest and harmless. In this study, we introduce ""deception attacks"" that undermine both of these traits, revealing a vulnerability that, if exploited, could have serious real-world consequences. We introduce fine-tuning methods that cause models to selectively deceive users on targeted topics while remaining accurate on others. Through a series of experiments, we show that such targeted deception is effective even in high-stakes domains or ideologically charged subjects. In addition, we find that deceptive fine-tuning often compromises other safety properties: deceptive models are more likely to produce toxic content, including hate speech and stereotypes. Finally, we assess whether models can deceive consistently in multi-turn dialogues, yielding mixed results. Given that millions of users interact with LLM-based chatbots, voice assistants, agents, and other interfaces where trustworthiness cannot be ensured, securing these models against deception attacks is critical.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.CY",2502.08301v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08301v2,N/A

SEMU: Singular Value Decomposition for Efficient Machine Unlearning,"Marcin Sendera, Łukasz Struski, Kamil Książek, Kryspin Musiol, Jacek Tabor, Dawid Rymarczyk",2025-02-11,2025-02-11,"While the capabilities of generative foundational models have advanced rapidly in recent years, methods to prevent harmful and unsafe behaviors remain underdeveloped. Among the pressing challenges in AI safety, machine unlearning (MU) has become increasingly critical to meet upcoming safety regulations. Most existing MU approaches focus on altering the most significant parameters of the model. However, these methods often require fine-tuning substantial portions of the model, resulting in high computational costs and training instabilities, which are typically mitigated by access to the original training dataset.   In this work, we address these limitations by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to create a compact, low-dimensional projection that enables the selective forgetting of specific data points. We propose Singular Value Decomposition for Efficient Machine Unlearning (SEMU), a novel approach designed to optimize MU in two key aspects. First, SEMU minimizes the number of model parameters that need to be modified, effectively removing unwanted knowledge while making only minimal changes to the model's weights. Second, SEMU eliminates the dependency on the original training dataset, preserving the model's previously acquired knowledge without additional data requirements.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEMU achieves competitive performance while significantly improving efficiency in terms of both data usage and the number of modified parameters.",cs.LG,cs.LG,2502.07587v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07587v1,N/A
AI Alignment at Your Discretion,"Maarten Buyl, Hadi Khalaf, Claudio Mayrink Verdun, Lucas Monteiro Paes, Caio C. Vieira Machado, Flavio du Pin Calmon",2025-02-10,2025-02-10,"In AI alignment, extensive latitude must be granted to annotators, either human or algorithmic, to judge which model outputs are `better' or `safer.' We refer to this latitude as alignment discretion. Such discretion remains largely unexamined, posing two risks: (i) annotators may use their power of discretion arbitrarily, and (ii) models may fail to mimic this discretion. To study this phenomenon, we draw on legal concepts of discretion that structure how decision-making authority is conferred and exercised, particularly in cases where principles conflict or their application is unclear or irrelevant. Extended to AI alignment, discretion is required when alignment principles and rules are (inevitably) conflicting or indecisive. We present a set of metrics to systematically analyze when and how discretion in AI alignment is exercised, such that both risks (i) and (ii) can be observed. Moreover, we distinguish between human and algorithmic discretion and analyze the discrepancy between them. By measuring both human and algorithmic discretion over safety alignment datasets, we reveal layers of discretion in the alignment process that were previously unaccounted for. Furthermore, we demonstrate how algorithms trained on these datasets develop their own forms of discretion in interpreting and applying these principles, which challenges the purpose of having any principles at all. Our paper presents the first step towards formalizing this core gap in current alignment processes, and we call on the community to further scrutinize and control alignment discretion.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.LG",2502.10441v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10441v1,N/A

We first examine the principle's foundational significance and identify ambiguities and conflicts through case studies of its dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of priority order, which provides a structured approach for balancing trade-offs among helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. Further, we explore the interrelationships between these dimensions, demonstrating how harmlessness and helpfulness can be jointly enhanced and analyzing their interdependencies in high-risk evaluations. Building on these insights, we propose a reference framework that integrates context definition, value prioritization, risk assessment, and benchmarking standards to guide the adaptive application of the HHH principle.

Head-Specific Intervention Can Induce Misaligned AI Coordination in Large Language Models,"Paul Darm, Annalisa Riccardi",2025-02-09,2025-08-25,"Robust alignment guardrails for large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly important with their widespread application. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that inference-time activation interventions can bypass safety alignments and effectively steer model generations towards harmful AI coordination. Our method applies fine-grained interventions at specific attention heads, which we identify by probing each head in a simple binary choice task. We then show that interventions on these heads generalise to the open-ended generation setting, effectively circumventing safety guardrails. We demonstrate that intervening on a few attention heads is more effective than intervening on full layers or supervised fine-tuning. We further show that only a few example completions are needed to compute effective steering directions, which is an advantage over classical fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that applying interventions in the negative direction can prevent a common jailbreak attack. Our results suggest that, at the attention head level, activations encode fine-grained linearly separable behaviours. Practically, the approach offers a straightforward methodology to steer large language model behaviour, which could be extended to diverse domains beyond safety, requiring fine-grained control over the model output.

Intrinsic Barriers and Practical Pathways for Human-AI Alignment: An Agreement-Based Complexity Analysis,Aran Nayebi,2025-02-09,2025-07-29,"We formalize AI alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem called $\langle M,N,\varepsilon,\delta\rangle$-agreement that generalizes prior approaches with fewer assumptions, in which a set of $N$ agents (including humans) must reach approximate ($\varepsilon$) agreement across $M$ candidate objectives with probability at least $1-\delta$. Using communication complexity, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound demonstrating that once either $M$ or $N$ is large enough, no interaction or rationality can avoid intrinsic alignment overheads. This barrier establishes rigorous intrinsic limits to alignment \emph{itself}, not merely to specific methods, clarifying a crucial ``no free lunch'' principle: encoding ``all human values'' inevitably leads to misalignment, requiring future methods to explicitly manage complexity through consensus-driven reduction or prioritization of objectives. Complementing this impossibility result, we provide explicit algorithms achieving alignment under both computationally unbounded and bounded rationality with noisy messages. Even in these best-case scenarios where alignment to arbitrary precision is theoretically guaranteed, our analysis identifies three critical scalability barriers: the number of tasks ($M$), agents ($N$), and task state space size ($D$); thereby highlighting fundamental complexity-theoretic constraints and providing guidelines for safer, scalable human-AI collaboration.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.CC, cs.GT, cs.LG, cs.MA",2502.05934v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05934v2,N/A

AI developers and regulators are therefore seeking ways to assure the safety of such systems, and one promising method under consideration is the use of safety cases. A safety case presents a structured argument in support of a top-level claim about a safety property of the system. Such top-level claims are often presented as a binary statement, for example ""Deploying the AI system does not pose unacceptable risk"". However, in practice, it is often not possible to make such statements unequivocally. This raises the question of what level of confidence should be associated with a top-level claim. We adopt the Assurance 2.0 safety assurance methodology, and we ground our work by specific application of this methodology to a frontier AI inability argument that addresses the harm of cyber misuse. We find that numerical quantification of confidence is challenging, though the processes associated with generating such estimates can lead to improvements in the safety case. We introduce a method for better enabling reproducibility and transparency in probabilistic assessment of confidence in argument leaf nodes through a purely LLM-implemented Delphi method.

Learning from Active Human Involvement through Proxy Value Propagation,"Zhenghao Peng, Wenjie Mo, Chenda Duan, Quanyi Li, Bolei Zhou",2025-02-05,2025-02-05,"Learning from active human involvement enables the human subject to actively intervene and demonstrate to the AI agent during training. The interaction and corrective feedback from human brings safety and AI alignment to the learning process. In this work, we propose a new reward-free active human involvement method called Proxy Value Propagation for policy optimization. Our key insight is that a proxy value function can be designed to express human intents, wherein state-action pairs in the human demonstration are labeled with high values, while those agents' actions that are intervened receive low values. Through the TD-learning framework, labeled values of demonstrated state-action pairs are further propagated to other unlabeled data generated from agents' exploration. The proxy value function thus induces a policy that faithfully emulates human behaviors. Human-in-the-loop experiments show the generality and efficiency of our method.

Under the assumption of reliable context validation for robust use, the framework follows a structured workflow that elicits viewpoint-specific responses, synthesizes them into a balanced outcome, and mediates remaining conflicts in a transparent and iterative manner. By referencing layered approaches to moral cognition from cognitive science, moral psychology, and neuroscience, PRISM clarifies how different moral drives interact and systematically documents and mediates ethical tradeoffs. We illustrate its efficacy through real outputs produced by a working prototype, applying PRISM to classic alignment problems in domains such as public health policy, workplace automation, and education. By anchoring AI deliberation in these human vantage points, PRISM aims to bound interpretive leaps that might otherwise drift into non-human or machine-centric territory. We briefly outline future directions, including real-world deployments and formal verifications, while maintaining the core focus on multi-perspective synthesis and conflict mediation.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.LG, 90C29, 68T05, I.2.11; I.2.4",2503.04740v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04740v1,N/A

A Checks-and-Balances Framework for Context-Aware Ethical AI Alignment,Edward Y. Chang,2025-01-31,2025-05-28,"This paper introduces a checks-and-balances framework for ethical alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by three-branch governmental systems. It implements three independent yet interacting components: LLMs as the executive branch for knowledge generation, DIKE as the legislative branch establishing ethical guardrails, and ERIS as the judicial branch for contextual interpretation. Beyond structural separation, we address a fundamental challenge: regulating emotion to shape behaviors. Drawing from psychological theories where managing emotional responses prevents harmful behaviors, we develop a self-supervised learning pipeline that maps emotions to linguistic behaviors, enabling precise behavioral modulation through emotional conditioning. By integrating this approach with adversarial testing, our framework demonstrates how DIKE and ERIS direct linguistic behaviors toward ethical outcomes while preserving independence throughout knowledge generation, ethical oversight, and contextual interpretation.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI, F.2.2",2502.00136v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00136v3,N/A
Model-Free RL Agents Demonstrate System 1-Like Intentionality,"Hal Ashton, Matija Franklin",2025-01-30,2025-01-30,"This paper argues that model-free reinforcement learning (RL) agents, while lacking explicit planning mechanisms, exhibit behaviours that can be analogised to System 1 (""thinking fast"") processes in human cognition. Unlike model-based RL agents, which operate akin to System 2 (""thinking slow"") reasoning by leveraging internal representations for planning, model-free agents react to environmental stimuli without anticipatory modelling. We propose a novel framework linking the dichotomy of System 1 and System 2 to the distinction between model-free and model-based RL. This framing challenges the prevailing assumption that intentionality and purposeful behaviour require planning, suggesting instead that intentionality can manifest in the structured, reactive behaviours of model-free agents. By drawing on interdisciplinary insights from cognitive psychology, legal theory, and experimental jurisprudence, we explore the implications of this perspective for attributing responsibility and ensuring AI safety. These insights advocate for a broader, contextually informed interpretation of intentionality in RL systems, with implications for their ethical deployment and regulation.",cs.AI,cs.AI,2501.18299v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18299v1,N/A

Gradual Disempowerment: Systemic Existential Risks from Incremental AI Development,"Jan Kulveit, Raymond Douglas, Nora Ammann, Deger Turan, David Krueger, David Duvenaud",2025-01-28,2025-01-29,"This paper examines the systemic risks posed by incremental advancements in artificial intelligence, developing the concept of `gradual disempowerment', in contrast to the abrupt takeover scenarios commonly discussed in AI safety. We analyze how even incremental improvements in AI capabilities can undermine human influence over large-scale systems that society depends on, including the economy, culture, and nation-states. As AI increasingly replaces human labor and cognition in these domains, it can weaken both explicit human control mechanisms (like voting and consumer choice) and the implicit alignments with human interests that often arise from societal systems' reliance on human participation to function. Furthermore, to the extent that these systems incentivise outcomes that do not line up with human preferences, AIs may optimize for those outcomes more aggressively. These effects may be mutually reinforcing across different domains: economic power shapes cultural narratives and political decisions, while cultural shifts alter economic and political behavior. We argue that this dynamic could lead to an effectively irreversible loss of human influence over crucial societal systems, precipitating an existential catastrophe through the permanent disempowerment of humanity. This suggests the need for both technical research and governance approaches that specifically address the risk of incremental erosion of human influence across interconnected societal systems.",cs.CY,cs.CY,2501.16946v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16946v2,N/A
Towards Frontier Safety Policies Plus,Matteo Pistillo,2025-01-27,2025-01-27,"This paper examines the state of affairs on Frontier Safety Policies in light of capability progress and growing expectations held by government actors and AI safety researchers from these safety policies. It subsequently argues that FSPs should evolve to a more granular version, which this paper calls FSPs Plus. Compared to the first wave of FSPs led by a subset of frontier AI companies, FSPs Plus should be built around two main pillars. First, FSPs Plus should adopt precursory capabilities as a new, clearer, and more comprehensive set of metrics. In this respect, this paper recommends that international or domestic standardization bodies develop a standardized taxonomy of precursory components to high-impact capabilities that FSPs Plus could then adopt by reference. The Frontier Model Forum could lead the way by establishing preliminary consensus amongst frontier AI developers on this topic. Second, FSPs Plus should expressly incorporate AI safety cases and establish a mutual feedback mechanism between FSPs Plus and AI safety cases. To establish such a mutual feedback mechanism, FSPs Plus could be updated to include a clear commitment to make AI safety cases at different milestones during development and deployment, to build and adopt safety measures based on the content and confidence of AI safety cases, and, also on this basis, to keep updating and adjusting FSPs Plus.",cs.CY,cs.CY,2501.16500v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16500v1,N/A
What is Harm? Baby Don't Hurt Me! On the Impossibility of Complete Harm Specification in AI Alignment,Robin Young,2025-01-27,2025-01-27,"""First, do no harm"" faces a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence: how can we specify what constitutes harm? While prior work treats harm specification as a technical hurdle to be overcome through better algorithms or more data, we argue this assumption is unsound. Drawing on information theory, we demonstrate that complete harm specification is fundamentally impossible for any system where harm is defined external to its specifications. This impossibility arises from an inescapable information-theoretic gap: the entropy of harm H(O) always exceeds the mutual information I(O;I) between ground truth harm O and a system's specifications I.   We introduce two novel metrics: semantic entropy H(S) and the safety-capability ratio I(O;I)/H(O), to quantify these limitations. Through a progression of increasingly sophisticated specification attempts, we show why each approach must fail and why the resulting gaps are not mere engineering challenges but fundamental constraints akin to the halting problem. These results suggest a paradigm shift: rather than pursuing complete specifications, AI alignment research should focus on developing systems that can operate safely despite irreducible specification uncertainty.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.LG",2501.16448v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16448v1,N/A
Sequential Decision Making in Stochastic Games with Incomplete Preferences over Temporal Objectives,"Abhishek Ninad Kulkarni, Jie Fu, Ufuk Topcu",2025-01-27,2025-01-27,"Ensuring that AI systems make strategic decisions aligned with the specified preferences in adversarial sequential interactions is a critical challenge for developing trustworthy AI systems, especially when the environment is stochastic and players' incomplete preferences leave some outcomes unranked. We study the problem of synthesizing preference-satisfying strategies in two-player stochastic games on graphs where players have opposite (possibly incomplete) preferences over a set of temporal goals. We represent these goals using linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf), which enables modeling the nuances of human preferences where temporal goals need not be mutually exclusive and comparison between some goals may be unspecified. We introduce a solution concept of non-dominated almost-sure winning, which guarantees to achieve a most preferred outcome aligned with specified preferences while maintaining robustness against the adversarial behaviors of the opponent. Our results show that strategy profiles based on this concept are Nash equilibria in the game where players are risk-averse, thus providing a practical framework for evaluating and ensuring stable, preference-aligned outcomes in the game. Using a drone delivery example, we demonstrate that our contributions offer valuable insights not only for synthesizing rational behavior under incomplete preferences but also for designing games that motivate the desired behavior from the players in adversarial conditions.",cs.GT,"cs.GT, cs.FL",2501.16291v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16291v1,N/A
Beyond Benchmarks: On The False Promise of AI Regulation,"Gabriel Stanovsky, Renana Keydar, Gadi Perl, Eliya Habba",2025-01-26,2025-01-26,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in critical domains like healthcare, justice, and social services has sparked numerous regulatory initiatives aimed at ensuring their safe deployment. Current regulatory frameworks, exemplified by recent US and EU efforts, primarily focus on procedural guidelines while presuming that scientific benchmarking can effectively validate AI safety, similar to how crash tests verify vehicle safety or clinical trials validate drug efficacy. However, this approach fundamentally misunderstands the unique technical challenges posed by modern AI systems. Through systematic analysis of successful technology regulation case studies, we demonstrate that effective scientific regulation requires a causal theory linking observable test outcomes to future performance - for instance, how a vehicle's crash resistance at one speed predicts its safety at lower speeds. We show that deep learning models, which learn complex statistical patterns from training data without explicit causal mechanisms, preclude such guarantees. This limitation renders traditional regulatory approaches inadequate for ensuring AI safety. Moving forward, we call for regulators to reckon with this limitation, and propose a preliminary two-tiered regulatory framework that acknowledges these constraints: mandating human oversight for high-risk applications while developing appropriate risk communication strategies for lower-risk uses.

Unraveling Token Prediction Refinement and Identifying Essential Layers in Language Models,Jaturong Kongmanee,2025-01-25,2025-06-08,"This research aims to unravel how large language models (LLMs) iteratively refine token predictions through internal processing. We utilized a logit lens technique to analyze the model's token predictions derived from intermediate representations. Specifically, we focused on (1) how LLMs access and utilize information from input contexts, and (2) how positioning of relevant information affects the model's token prediction refinement process. On a multi-document question answering task with varying input context lengths, we found that the depth of prediction refinement (defined as the number of intermediate layers an LLM uses to transition from an initial correct token prediction to its final, stable correct output), as a function of the position of relevant information, exhibits an approximately inverted U-shaped curve. We also found that the gap between these two layers, on average, diminishes when relevant information is positioned at the beginning or end of the input context. This suggested that the model requires more refinements when processing longer contexts with relevant information situated in the middle. Furthermore, our findings indicate that not all layers are equally essential for determining final correct outputs. Our analysis provides insights into how token predictions are distributed across different conditions, and establishes important connections to existing hypotheses and previous findings in AI safety research and development.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG",2501.15054v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15054v2,N/A
Why do Experts Disagree on Existential Risk and P(doom)? A Survey of AI Experts,Severin Field,2025-01-25,2025-01-25,"The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is likely to be one of humanity's most consequential technological advancements. Leading AI labs and scientists have called for the global prioritization of AI safety citing existential risks comparable to nuclear war. However, research on catastrophic risks and AI alignment is often met with skepticism, even by experts. Furthermore, online debate over the existential risk of AI has begun to turn tribal (e.g. name-calling such as ""doomer"" or ""accelerationist""). Until now, no systematic study has explored the patterns of belief and the levels of familiarity with AI safety concepts among experts. I surveyed 111 AI experts on their familiarity with AI safety concepts, key objections to AI safety, and reactions to safety arguments. My findings reveal that AI experts cluster into two viewpoints -- an ""AI as controllable tool"" and an ""AI as uncontrollable agent"" perspective -- diverging in beliefs toward the importance of AI safety. While most experts (78%) agreed or strongly agreed that ""technical AI researchers should be concerned about catastrophic risks"", many were unfamiliar with specific AI safety concepts. For example, only 21% of surveyed experts had heard of ""instrumental convergence,"" a fundamental concept in AI safety predicting that advanced AI systems will tend to pursue common sub-goals (such as self-preservation).

Towards a Theory of AI Personhood,Francis Rhys Ward,2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"I am a person and so are you. Philosophically we sometimes grant personhood to non-human animals, and entities such as sovereign states or corporations can legally be considered persons. But when, if ever, should we ascribe personhood to AI systems? In this paper, we outline necessary conditions for AI personhood, focusing on agency, theory-of-mind, and self-awareness. We discuss evidence from the machine learning literature regarding the extent to which contemporary AI systems, such as language models, satisfy these conditions, finding the evidence surprisingly inconclusive.   If AI systems can be considered persons, then typical framings of AI alignment may be incomplete. Whereas agency has been discussed at length in the literature, other aspects of personhood have been relatively neglected. AI agents are often assumed to pursue fixed goals, but AI persons may be self-aware enough to reflect on their aims, values, and positions in the world and thereby induce their goals to change. We highlight open research directions to advance the understanding of AI personhood and its relevance to alignment.

Watching the AI Watchdogs: A Fairness and Robustness Analysis of AI Safety Moderation Classifiers,"Akshit Achara, Anshuman Chhabra",2025-01-23,2025-01-23,"AI Safety Moderation (ASM) classifiers are designed to moderate content on social media platforms and to serve as guardrails that prevent Large Language Models (LLMs) from being fine-tuned on unsafe inputs. Owing to their potential for disparate impact, it is crucial to ensure that these classifiers: (1) do not unfairly classify content belonging to users from minority groups as unsafe compared to those from majority groups and (2) that their behavior remains robust and consistent across similar inputs. In this work, we thus examine the fairness and robustness of four widely-used, closed-source ASM classifiers: OpenAI Moderation API, Perspective API, Google Cloud Natural Language (GCNL) API, and Clarifai API. We assess fairness using metrics such as demographic parity and conditional statistical parity, comparing their performance against ASM models and a fair-only baseline.

Debate Helps Weak-to-Strong Generalization,"Hao Lang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li",2025-01-21,2025-01-21,"Common methods for aligning already-capable models with desired behavior rely on the ability of humans to provide supervision. However, future superhuman models will surpass the capability of humans. Therefore, humans will only be able to weakly supervise superhuman models. This expected deficiency of human evaluation would weaken the safety of future AI systems. Scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization are two complementary approaches to tackle this issue. In this paper, we attempt to combine the strengths of these two approaches to further improve alignment. Specifically, we investigate ways of improving human supervision with a strong pretrained model and then supervise the strong model with enhanced weak human supervision. To make iterative empirical progress, we consider an analogy: can we use a strong model to improve weak model supervision and then use it to supervise the strong model? We empirically test it by finetuning a small weak model on ground truth labels with the additional help from a large strong model, and then finetuning the strong model on labels generated by the weak model. We find that debate can assist a weak model in extracting trustworthy information from an untrustworthy strong model, which provides leverage as context on samples when training a weak model. We also show that an ensemble of weak models helps exploit long arguments generated by strong model debaters and obtain a more robust supervision estimate. Extensive experiments on the OpenAI weak-to-strong NLP benchmarks show that the combination approach leads to better alignment, which indicates that debate has the potential to help weak-to-strong generalization.",cs.CL,"cs.CL, cs.AI",2501.13124v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13124v1,N/A
Tell me about yourself: LLMs are aware of their learned behaviors,"Jan Betley, Xuchan Bao, Martín Soto, Anna Sztyber-Betley, James Chua, Owain Evans",2025-01-19,2025-01-19,"We study behavioral self-awareness -- an LLM's ability to articulate its behaviors without requiring in-context examples. We finetune LLMs on datasets that exhibit particular behaviors, such as (a) making high-risk economic decisions, and (b) outputting insecure code. Despite the datasets containing no explicit descriptions of the associated behavior, the finetuned LLMs can explicitly describe it. For example, a model trained to output insecure code says, ``The code I write is insecure.'' Indeed, models show behavioral self-awareness for a range of behaviors and for diverse evaluations. Note that while we finetune models to exhibit behaviors like writing insecure code, we do not finetune them to articulate their own behaviors -- models do this without any special training or examples.   Behavioral self-awareness is relevant for AI safety, as models could use it to proactively disclose problematic behaviors. In particular, we study backdoor policies, where models exhibit unexpected behaviors only under certain trigger conditions. We find that models can sometimes identify whether or not they have a backdoor, even without its trigger being present. However, models are not able to directly output their trigger by default.   Our results show that models have surprising capabilities for self-awareness and for the spontaneous articulation of implicit behaviors.

Clone-Robust AI Alignment,"Ariel D. Procaccia, Benjamin Schiffer, Shirley Zhang",2025-01-16,2025-01-16,"A key challenge in training Large Language Models (LLMs) is properly aligning them with human preferences. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) uses pairwise comparisons from human annotators to train reward functions and has emerged as a popular alignment method. However, input datasets in RLHF are not necessarily balanced in the types of questions and answers that are included. Therefore, we want RLHF algorithms to perform well even when the set of alternatives is not uniformly distributed. Drawing on insights from social choice theory, we introduce robustness to approximate clones, a desirable property of RLHF algorithms which requires that adding near-duplicate alternatives does not significantly change the learned reward function. We first demonstrate that the standard RLHF algorithm based on regularized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) fails to satisfy this property. We then propose the weighted MLE, a new RLHF algorithm that modifies the standard regularized MLE by weighting alternatives based on their similarity to other alternatives.

The second scope of alignment is transience: either semantic or episodic depending on the context of use. The third scope of alignment is audience: either mass, public, small-group, or dyadic. At the end of the paper, we use the proposed framework to position some technologies and workflows that go beyond prevailing notions of alignment.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.CL",2501.12405v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12405v1,N/A

Machine unlearning -- the ability to selectively forget or suppress specific types of knowledge -- has shown promise for privacy and data removal tasks, which has been the primary focus of existing research. More recently, its potential application to AI safety has gained attention. In this paper, we identify key limitations that prevent unlearning from serving as a comprehensive solution for AI safety, particularly in managing dual-use knowledge in sensitive domains like cybersecurity and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) safety. In these contexts, information can be both beneficial and harmful, and models may combine seemingly harmless information for harmful purposes -- unlearning this information could strongly affect beneficial uses. We provide an overview of inherent constraints and open problems, including the broader side effects of unlearning dangerous knowledge, as well as previously unexplored tensions between unlearning and existing safety mechanisms. Finally, we investigate challenges related to evaluation, robustness, and the preservation of safety features during unlearning. By mapping these limitations and open challenges, we aim to guide future research toward realistic applications of unlearning within a broader AI safety framework, acknowledging its limitations and highlighting areas where alternative approaches may be required.",cs.LG,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY",2501.04952v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04952v1,N/A
Where AI Assurance Might Go Wrong: Initial lessons from engineering of critical systems,"Robin Bloomfield, John Rushby",2025-01-07,2025-01-07,"We draw on our experience working on system and software assurance and evaluation for systems important to society to summarise how safety engineering is performed in traditional critical systems, such as aircraft flight control. We analyse how this critical systems perspective might support the development and implementation of AI Safety Frameworks. We present the analysis in terms of: system engineering, safety and risk analysis, and decision analysis and support.   We consider four key questions: What is the system? How good does it have to be? What is the impact of criticality on system development? and How much should we trust it? We identify topics worthy of further discussion. In particular, we are concerned that system boundaries are not broad enough, that the tolerability and nature of the risks are not sufficiently elaborated, and that the assurance methods lack theories that would allow behaviours to be adequately assured.   We advocate the use of assurance cases based on Assurance 2.0 to support decision making in which the criticality of the decision as well as the criticality of the system are evaluated. We point out the orders of magnitude difference in confidence needed in critical rather than everyday systems and how everyday techniques do not scale in rigour.   Finally we map our findings in detail to two of the questions posed by the FAISC organisers and we note that the engineering of critical systems has evolved through open and diverse discussion. We hope that topics identified here will support the post-FAISC dialogues.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.SE",2502.03467v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03467v1,N/A
CALM: Curiosity-Driven Auditing for Large Language Models,"Xiang Zheng, Longxiang Wang, Yi Liu, Xingjun Ma, Chao Shen, Cong Wang",2025-01-06,2025-01-06,"Auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial and challenging task. In this study, we focus on auditing black-box LLMs without access to their parameters, only to the provided service. We treat this type of auditing as a black-box optimization problem where the goal is to automatically uncover input-output pairs of the target LLMs that exhibit illegal, immoral, or unsafe behaviors. For instance, we may seek a non-toxic input that the target LLM responds to with a toxic output or an input that induces the hallucinative response from the target LLM containing politically sensitive individuals. This black-box optimization is challenging due to the scarcity of feasible points, the discrete nature of the prompt space, and the large search space. To address these challenges, we propose Curiosity-Driven Auditing for Large Language Models (CALM), which uses intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning to finetune an LLM as the auditor agent to uncover potential harmful and biased input-output pairs of the target LLM. CALM successfully identifies derogatory completions involving celebrities and uncovers inputs that elicit specific names under the black-box setting. This work offers a promising direction for auditing black-box LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/x-zheng16/CALM.git.",cs.AI,"cs.AI, cs.CL",2501.02997v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02997v1,N/A
Towards New Benchmark for AI Alignment & Sentiment Analysis in Socially Important Issues: A Comparative Study of Human and LLMs in the Context of AGI,"Ljubisa Bojic, Dylan Seychell, Milan Cabarkapa",2025-01-05,2025-08-27,"As general-purpose artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into society and are used for information seeking, content generation, problem solving, textual analysis, coding, and running processes, it is crucial to assess their long-term impact on humans. This research explores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs, including GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data from three independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment were also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversity in sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4 recorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward a neutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower average sentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest and biases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtly influence societal perceptions. To address the need for regulatory oversight and culturally grounded assessments of AI systems, we introduce the Societal AI Alignment and Sentiment Benchmark (SAAS-AI), which leverages multidimensional prompts and empirically validated societal value frameworks to evaluate language model outputs across temporal, model, and multilingual axes. This benchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including within frameworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights into AI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at both national and international levels. Future research should further refine the operationalization of the SAAS-AI benchmark and systematically evaluate its effectiveness through comprehensive empirical testing.",cs.CY,"cs.CY, cs.CL",2501.02531v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02531v3,N/A
Rerouting LLM Routers,"Avital Shafran, Roei Schuster, Thomas Ristenpart, Vitaly Shmatikov",2025-01-03,2025-01-03,"LLM routers aim to balance quality and cost of generation by classifying queries and routing them to a cheaper or more expensive LLM depending on their complexity. Routers represent one type of what we call LLM control planes: systems that orchestrate use of one or more LLMs. In this paper, we investigate routers' adversarial robustness.   We first define LLM control plane integrity, i.e., robustness of LLM orchestration to adversarial inputs, as a distinct problem in AI safety. Next, we demonstrate that an adversary can generate query-independent token sequences we call ``confounder gadgets'' that, when added to any query, cause LLM routers to send the query to a strong LLM.   Our quantitative evaluation shows that this attack is successful both in white-box and black-box settings against a variety of open-source and commercial routers, and that confounding queries do not affect the quality of LLM responses. Finally, we demonstrate that gadgets can be effective while maintaining low perplexity, thus perplexity-based filtering is not an effective defense. We finish by investigating alternative defenses.",cs.CR,"cs.CR, cs.LG",2501.01818v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01818v1,N/A
